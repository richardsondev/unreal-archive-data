description: "A small valley on the skaarj occupied planet Mah Kran, humans colonized\
  \ this area because of the now dried-up river and ruins which could be used as shelter.\
  \  Unknown to them was the fact that these ruins were sacred ruins of a skaarj temple.\
  \  Soon after colonizing the valley, a skaarj military patrol found the human camp\
  \ and slaughtered the unsuspecting settlers.  Now known as the Amritsar Massacre,\
  \ it is said the river ran red with blood...will yours be added to this battleground?"
