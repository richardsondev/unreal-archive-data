description: "When one of the small underground storage facilities on the small and\
  \ deadly planet Dargol XI appeared on the market, Liandri snapped it up and made\
  \ it into an arena. As the deadly atmosphere wreaks havoc on the planets surface,\
  \ allowing life in only plants, Gorge slowly lifts his Flak cannon and makes Cannonball\
  \ into a splatter mark.||Welcome to the Blue Noise Storage Facility...||"
