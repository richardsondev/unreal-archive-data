description: "J Howlett, the second great CEO of Liandri, was a man of tradition.\
  \ As the Tournaments rolled on through season after season he would always think\
  \ back to the original game, developed by his fore-fathers. A Claustropobic game\
  \ of speed and destruction. A Dark Place where winners would Walk on Air. After\
  \ his death, Liandri celebrated his life and love of traditional contest with the\
  \ construction of a new arena, inspired by his writings, and created from a iron\
  \ smelting works in the town of his birth. Here new-comers to the tournament can\
  \ see whether his laments had been hollow ramblings, or a forgotten passion."
