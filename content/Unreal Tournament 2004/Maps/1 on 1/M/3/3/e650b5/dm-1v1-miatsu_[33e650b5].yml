description: "The Miatsu partnership, which is known to specialise in the narcotics\
  \ and stimulants industry recently donated this small manufacturing complex to the\
  \ Liandri corp in gratitude for aiding Miatsu expand its customer base. It has therefore\
  \ become a favourite of the 'alternative' deathmatch fan owing to, in part, somewhat\
  \ unconventional advertising techniques utilised by Liandri's marketing division."
