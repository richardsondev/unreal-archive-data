description: "Long in the past, somewhere on the border between China and Japan, laid\
  \ the beautiful city of Ownanoobasaki. A city of honor and grace... Here there lived\
  \ a young prince, burning with the vengance of his dead father.  Three hundred yards\
  \ down the road, take a left, then a right past the dirty wooden shack and you'll\
  \ be in the town of Nagem. This town was abandoned long... long ago. Briefly to\
  \ be brought back to life by a passing throng of circus freaks who performed in\
  \ the hills nearby.... Then forgotten again. Then one day a man appeared. Dressed\
  \ in black... no wait.. it was brown... with high strapped boots, and these cute\
  \ little gloves. You know the ones you find at... Oh... Nevermind."
