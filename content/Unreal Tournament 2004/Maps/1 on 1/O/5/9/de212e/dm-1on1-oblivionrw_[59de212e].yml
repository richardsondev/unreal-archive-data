description: "Wordsworth once said 'I wondered lonely as a cloud'. Never was this\
  \ truer than for the Oblivion.With only the black vastness of deep space to serenade\
  \ her with the echoes of battles won and lost, and stars born and died.For a time\
  \ she has the company of the Tournament, and she is glad of it. Mens lives are but\
  \ a strobe of light in time and in her many years the Oblivion has come to regard\
  \ life as space does. Temporary.                                               In\
  \ her arena, very temporary."
