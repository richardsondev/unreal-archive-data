description: "One of the few remaining liquid plasma relay stations left on Mars,\
  \ the Raize facility was converted  to tournament use by the Liandri corp after\
  \ an active vlcanoe was discovered near the now abandoned city. Due to its instability\
  \ it has become a favourite of bookies and gamblers wishing to bet on total destruction\
  \ of the arena. It is for this reason also that it is favored for 1on1 grudge matches."
