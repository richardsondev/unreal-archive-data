description: "Team Inevitable Presents: The hidden Storehouse of Inevitability, previously\
  \ used by the L.O.F.T (Local Orbital Freight Transport) Group for the covert storage\
  \ of large amounts of interstellar cargo, vanished during the Humanoid Army raids\
  \ on the 3rd and 6th dimensions. When the raids ended in 2380, the storehouse was\
  \ rediscovered in the vicinity of an 11th dimensional hole that had torn open in\
  \ known space - a repercussion of the multi dimensional war. By conincidence it\
  \ appeared in perfect alignnment with the iFullTower, Liandri's ultimate gaming\
  \ arena."
