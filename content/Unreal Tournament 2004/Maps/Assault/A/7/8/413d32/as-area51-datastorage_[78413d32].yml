description: "The famous secret military base named Area 51 on Earth was thought to\
  \ be lost forever, but a recent archaeologist expedition uncovered a warehouse filled\
  \ with fairly large amount of now outdated technology. The technology is question\
  \ are mostly prototypes of technology used now, so the major  corporations  of the\
  \ galaxy became very interested in finding more of the base to see if there is something\
  \ that has yet to be fully exploited. Dozens of agents were sent to Area 51 from\
  \ each corporation all hoping to make a profit. Yet, even after all these years,\
  \ there was still a shadowy organization that wished the secrets of Area 51 to remain\
  \ hidden. Before the agents had time to decode the information stored in the data\
  \ archive, dozens of hired mercenaries landed near the front gate and became to\
  \ lay siege in an attempt to destroy the archive before the agents could finish.\
  \ This scenario is a recreation of the ensuing struggle between the agents of the\
  \ corporations and the mercenaries sent to destroy those secrets."
