description: "This scenario recreates the Skaarj Invasion of the planet Acatana. The\
  \ planet, uninhabitable by most lifeforms, had long been the home of a secret group\
  \ of human scientists, a division of the NEG created with the sole purpose of researching\
  \ advanced weapons technology. With the surrounding asteroid field and their own\
  \ defence systems no race had been near the planet for years. That was, until the\
  \ Skaarj received word of the highly lucrative technology ripe for the taking."
