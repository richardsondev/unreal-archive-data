description: "After a number of desperate battles, the Earth fleet tracked the Renegades\
  \ to the Ancient world. The Renegades had one last trump up their sleves, for they\
  \ had unearthed two Reevers, both of which are linked via hyperspace cables, destroying\
  \ one will destroy the other. These must not reach Earth, for they have the power\
  \ to transform all life on any planet within their range. Finally your target is\
  \ the main Fleet Battleship, this carries the Biolabs for the transformer chips\
  \ that are controlling the Renegades. Something more sinister is controlling events\
  \ behind the scene, intelligence suggests that the source originates from the Ancients\
  \ PLANET!"
