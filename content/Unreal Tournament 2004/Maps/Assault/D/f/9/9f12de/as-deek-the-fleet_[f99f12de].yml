description: "The lost Fleet is here, stripping the Earth colonies of raw material\
  \ and life, it is said that something changed them, that now they eat their own.\
  \ Their own now being Earth, the greatest resource of flesh. This is Earth's Final\
  \ defence! Only the Starcraft carrier Lennet stands between the renegade fleet and\
  \ EARTH. Taking out key planetary attack/targeting controllers are your primary\
  \ concern, as this eliminates the fleets ability to attack earth from space. The\
  \ final mission is to stop the fleet injector craft from delivering it's chemical\
  \ payload."
