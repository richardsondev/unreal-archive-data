description: "In the spring of 2234, during the final stages of the Jungle Wars, \
  \ one key point of rebel resistance prevented the bombing and ultimate destruction\
  \ of the rebel city of Suralakin.  In a secret early morning raid, a group of marines\
  \ were sent to neutralize the fortified warehouse in the beautiful Antarius Valley\
  \ as well as the SAM site.  With only 10 minutes before the bombers were in SAM\
  \ range, the mission took a turn for the worst, and the seemingly simple mission\
  \ turned into one of the hardest fought battles of the war."
