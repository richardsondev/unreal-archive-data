description: "Welcome to Hellbenderworld! Your mission is to escape from this strange\
  \ world and return to earth. Before your flight back you have to complete a few\
  \ objectives to complete your flight. Your first mission is to activate the bridge\
  \ to the second objective. After completing the second objective you'll need to\
  \ destroy the fence. Now the fence has been destroyed, your way back to home is\
  \ clear! Take a Hellbender and drive it to the end so you can go back to earth.\
  \ You will need to take care of your enemy, if they win you will be locked here\
  \ forever! Enjoy the map!!"
