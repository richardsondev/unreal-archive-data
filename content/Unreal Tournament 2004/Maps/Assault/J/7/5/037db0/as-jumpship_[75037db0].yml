description: "During the height of the Corporation Wars, Liandri scientists created\
  \ a prototype warship capable of making its own jumps without the need for a jumpgate.\
  \  Shortly before going into operation, Izanagi spies learned of this prototype\
  \ jumpship and launched an operation to steal the warship giving the Izanagi Corporation\
  \ a significant advantage during the Wars.  This scenario recreates the historic\
  \ battle in which Izanagi forces infiltrated the prototype Liandri jumpship, activated\
  \ its engines and made a successful jump to Izanagi space."
