description: "It is too foggy to do what you normally do.. So you decide to go for\
  \ a drive in your tank. However, you find an unfinished road where the builders\
  \ are too busy looking up porn to finish building the road. So you must, destroy\
  \ the turret guarding the road, Then the fence blocking the road, the builders really\
  \ don't want you getting in, you must then drive through the unfinished road. This\
  \ is resembly tricky, and after a hard drive with lots of aggrivation. Which is\
  \ not why you came on the drive. You decide to teach the builders a lesson. You\
  \ must destroy their computer which stores all their porn, leaving them to do nothing\
  \ but get on with the work. You then continue your peaceful drive through the countryside,\
  \ in your tank. :D"
