description: "In the days of Atlantis, a mythical creature was solidified and buried\
  \ deep within the mountains. Many centuries later, a force tunneled into the rock,\
  \ building defensive tunnels along the way. Disguised by the acient surface, attackers\
  \ were fortunate to find the location just in time to launch an attack on the project\
  \ in hope of preventing the forces intentions of awakening the creature."
