description: "This scenario is a recreation of an assault of N E G forces on one of\
  \ there own bases after it was attacked and taken over by the hellions. Because\
  \ of the prototype space missile that was located inside the silo next to the base.\
  \ The N E G commanders saw no other option than to launch a strike force for the\
  \ base and destroy the missile by any means necessary. This missile held a highly\
  \ toxic plasma gas that was strong enough to destroy the entire N E G head quarters\
  \ in one single strike! Only 3 hours after the hellion attack a strike force landed.\
  \ With the soul goal of launching and destroying the missile, thereby securing a\
  \ complete strike to take back the base.   I used the network systems in the convoy\
  \ map to speed up build time and make al systems working ;p  but anyway this is\
  \ my FIRST assault map and i'm proud of it (took me some weeks to build so I hope\
  \ you like it) Have fun, frag hot, Hyperforce"
