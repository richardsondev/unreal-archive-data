  \ this new war vehicle, they quickly invaded the laboratory, stole the blueprints,\
  \ and took off with the Paladin prototype. Immediately, the S.S.P.'s alpha team\
  \ had tracked down the Skaarj bandits to a small Skaarj factory, hidden on the planet\
  \ Chronos. Their sole mission, to retrieve the Paladin blue prints and the prototype\
  \ before the Skaarj could start creating their own."
