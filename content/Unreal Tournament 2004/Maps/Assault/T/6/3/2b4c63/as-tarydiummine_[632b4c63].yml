description: "During the war against the Skarrj Tarydium Mines were high priorities,\
  \ the Tarydium crystals were a main source for weapons and power. After the war\
  \ most of the mines were destroyed to prevent any further mining of Tarydium as\
  \ well as to prevent them from getting into the wrong hands. Since some of the mines\
  \ were privately owned a few of the owners refused to shut them down because of\
  \ the high profit they got off them. They were warned, however, that there is a\
  \ possibility they may be found by another race, be killed, and have their Tarydium\
  \ stolen. Such a scenario was never a concern to the owners but to their surprise\
  \ it became a reality. The Hellions have invaded a mine on the rocky shores of Silex\
  \ Island. Your goal is to infiltrate the Tarydium mine and destroy the main power\
  \ generator to prevent any further mining of Tarydium."
