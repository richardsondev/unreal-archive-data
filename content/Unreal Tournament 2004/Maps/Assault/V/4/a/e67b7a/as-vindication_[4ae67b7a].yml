description: "Years ago, rebel forces had captured one of the NEG's communication\
  \ sites to coordinate with other factions for an all out take over of the NEG controlled\
  \ mountain region. During their retreat of the area, a few NEG squadrons decided\
  \ to take back what was once there own from the rebels. Using their extensive knowledge\
  \ of the area and the fact they knew the area better than the rebels occupying it,\
  \ NEG forces acted quickly to try and stop the rebels communication to other factions.\
  \  Since NEG forces weren't large enough to take back the communications array and\
  \ hold it for reinforcements, the plan involved the complete destruction of the\
  \ array."
