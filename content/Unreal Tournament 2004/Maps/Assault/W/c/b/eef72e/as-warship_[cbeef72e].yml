description: "While you were on a mission your spaceship crashed. You've got luck\
  \ and landed somewhere between some rocks in the sea. There's no way out or a way\
  \ to escape. After a little while you detect a ship, a huge ship. So maybe there's\
  \ still hope to exit! Your job is to discover the ship, disable the owners of it\
  \ and drive away from this awful place. Be careful and work together!"
