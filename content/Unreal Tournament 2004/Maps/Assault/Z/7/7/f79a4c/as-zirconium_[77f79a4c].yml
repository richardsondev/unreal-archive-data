description: "Following the fiasco of the Nexus Missile Confiscation, the Helians\
  \ devised a new plan in their attempts for mass destruction. Discovering the desert\
  \ planet Zirconium, named for its precious supply of nuclear-development material,\
  \ the Helians established a base there and began constructing their own warheads.\
  \ These warheads would be capable of much greater destruction than the Nexus Missiles,\
  \ and would be ideal for launching interplanetary strikes. Combined with the elements\
  \ native to Zirconium, the Helians would be able to use a combination of techniques\
  \ to speed up development. One of these techniques involved Core Conductor Beams,\
  \ which could meld materials together at super sonic speeds. Once again, a strike\
  \ force was sent in to halt the Helian's plans with the goal of destroying these\
  \ beams. However, the strike force surprised even Liandri when, in a daring suicide\
  \ mission, they were able to plant explosives inside the Command Center of the base,\
  \ and through a chain reaction, destroy the entire facility."
