description: "Doubtless DoubleDammage was a great map in the bombing run scene, there\
  \ have been renovations made toward the architechture. And along with help from\
  \ many experienced people from the bombing run community, BR-DoubleDammage has been\
  \ modified to give the fans a hopefully more exciting game. You are one of the first\
  \ warriors to engage in battle in this revamped arena, however fresh the paint may\
  \ be, it won't be long before the stench of your fellow comrades invades your nostrils\
  \ once again."
