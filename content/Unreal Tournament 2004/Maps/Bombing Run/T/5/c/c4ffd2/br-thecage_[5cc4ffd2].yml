description: "Located in the industrialized planet of Tigun, this big old rusty arena\
  \ once used to be a great deathmatch-event. Because of it's shape it was ideal for\
  \ one on one battles and the many entrances from the conecting storage and dressingrooms\
  \ gave the competators the ability to make stylish entrances. Unfortunately the\
  \ owner of the establishment went bankrubt and the arena was sold and turned into\
  \ a warehouse. Though the renovation the arena didn't change mutch and the infamous\
  \ text in the dressingrooms was untouched. A few years went and the latest owner\
  \ also went short on cash. Ironically the previous owner had gotten back on his\
  \ feet again and bought the arena back. He had too small funds to get it back in\
  \ bussiness but he knew that Liandri Corp was interested in purchasing it. After\
  \ some agreements the owner drove away with a transportvehicle full of cash and\
  \ the new owner started to renovate their new investment. Some of the supplies were\
  \ left from the arena's warehousedays but Liandri decided too keep them.  New lights\
  \ and other necessary equipment were installed and the killing started once more,\
  \ to a well paying crowd, in the arena were there is no escape..."
