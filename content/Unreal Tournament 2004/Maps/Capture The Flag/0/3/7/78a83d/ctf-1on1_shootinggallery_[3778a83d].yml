description: "This new map is not actually a ctf, there are no flags. The idea behind\
  \ this map is to to have only 2 players, or one player and a bot. Make sure to be\
  \ on the red team before starting the map so you will be the shooter. The idea for\
  \ this shooting gallery came from my unreal mentor Howdy. I simply figured out the\
  \ right way to get shooting gallery working to our expectations. Look to the near\
  \ future for more Howdy originals!!! The weapons available are: Classic sniper,\
  \ Shock rifle, assault, Flak Cannon, Rocket Launcher, Minigun, Bio, Greneade Launcher\
  \ but you'll get the idea. Map is very simple and will have updates and improvements\
  \ if a lot of people enjoy this one."
