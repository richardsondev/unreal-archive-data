description: "With Apologies to Major Henry Livingston Jr.||'Twas the night before\
  \ Christmas, when all thro' the house, Not a creature was stirring, not even an\
  \ optical mouse; The stockings were hung by the chimney with care, In hopes that\
  \ a fresh clip of ammo soon would be there;||The Dead Cats were nestled all snug\
  \ in their beds, While visions of noobies danc'd in their heads, And Puma in his\
  \ armor, and I in mine too, Went searching for a few extra cannisters of Goo ||When\
  \ out in the Pipe there arose such a clatter, We sprang from our seats to see what\
  \ was the matter. Away to the Sniperâ€™s Nest I flew like a flash, Broke out my Link\
  \ Gun, and prepared to make hash;.||The moon on the surface of new fallen snow,\
  \ Gave the lustre of mid-day to the ramps below; When, what to my wondering eyes\
  \ should appear, But a miniature Bulldog and eight little cats so near,||With a\
  \ little old driver, so gnarly and slack, I knew in a moment it must be St. Tack.\
  \ More rapid than rockets his kittens they came, And he taunted, and shouted, and\
  \ call'd them by name:||\"Now! Cronic, now! Sanecow, now! Benny, and Cray, \"On!\
  \ Scratch, on! Felix, on! Woof and Stray; \"To the top of the Pipe! to the top of\
  \ the hall! \"Now dodge away! dodge away! dodge away all!\"||As shattered gibs before\
  \ the shock combo fly, When they meet with a projectile, mount to the sky; So up\
  \ to the map-top the felines they flew, With the Bulldog full of ammo -- and St.\
  \ Tack too:||And then in a twinkling, I heard on the flat The scratching and hissing\
  \ of each little cat.  As I drew in my weapon, and was spinning around, Down the\
  \ chimney St. Tack came with a bound:||He was cover'd all in armor, from his head\
  \ to his foot, And his fur was all tarnish'd with ashes and soot; A bundle of ammo\
  \ packs was flung on his back, And he look'd like a junkie searching for crack:||His\
  \ eyes -- how they glowed! his teeth how scary, His claws were like knives, his\
  \ nose was so hairy; His droll little mouth was alight in a show. And the fur of\
  \ his chin was as white as the snow;||The spun-up Minigun he held tight in his hands,\
  \ And the smoke it emitted in broad swirling bands. He had a broad face, and a huge\
  \ gut so sublime That shook when he laugh'd, like a vat full of slime:||He was chubby\
  \ and plump, and a right jolly old cat, And I laugh'd when I saw him in spite of\
  \ all that; With a wink of his eye and a twist of his head Soon gave me to know\
  \ I had nothing to dread.||He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work, And\
  \ fill'd all the stockings; then turn'd with a jerk, And laying his finger aside\
  \ of his trigger Up the chimney he burrowed just like a chigger.||He sprung to his\
  \ Bulldog, to his team gave a taunt, And away they all flew, like ghosts on the\
  \ haunt:  But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight -- Happy Christmas\
  \ to all, and to all a good night.||"
