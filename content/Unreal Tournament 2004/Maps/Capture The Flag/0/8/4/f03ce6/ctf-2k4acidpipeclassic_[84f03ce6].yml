description: "An abandoned industrial site where cat urine was processed into military\
  \ grade chemical weaponry, Acid Pipe is now the most dangerous Low-Gravity environment\
  \ still used in the games.||The facility itself can kill you as quickly as the competition.||Avoid\
  \ the large cat urine holding tanks at all costs. Nose-Clips will help if you have\
  \ them handy.||"
