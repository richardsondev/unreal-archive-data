description: "Over the earth runs a battle to capture the enemy flag at three small\
  \ buildings but really high , with instant shot weapons like minigun and sniper\
  \ rifle and with an flak cannon at the middle as reward you must face the death\
  \ by fighting just with those weapons and your default inventory, if you fall, its\
  \ just sleep then next day you will wake up in the land under 5000 kilometers down."
