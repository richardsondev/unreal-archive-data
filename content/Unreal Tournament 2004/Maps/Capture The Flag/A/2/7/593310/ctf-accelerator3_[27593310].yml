description: "Two bases skim just above the volatile atmosphere of the planet Ragnarok,\
  \ and combatants launch themselves into battle surrounded by cold, hard vacuum.\
  \ It's fast, it's dangerous, and it violates enough laws of physics to make Einstein\
  \ turn over in his grave. This map is brought to you by Acceltech, maker of quality\
  \ accelerator tubes, jump pads and other gravitational/inertial manipulation devices\
  \ since 2207. And by Heetsinki Industrial Radiators - Be cool with Heetsinki!"
