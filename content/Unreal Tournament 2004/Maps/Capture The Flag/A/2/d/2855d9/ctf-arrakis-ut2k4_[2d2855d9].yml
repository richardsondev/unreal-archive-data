description: "Arrakis, the desert planet better known as Dune. There is never a drop\
  \ of rain, the open desert is ruled by massive Sand Worms and huge storms are a\
  \ threat to man and machine. Paul Muad'Dib once said 'God created Arrakis to train\
  \ the faithful'. Rubbish! 'God created Arrakis to train for the Tournament!' Because\
  \ of intense daytime temperatures, all matches on Dune are held at night. For the\
  \ victors, a safe flight back to spaceport. For the losers, the same fate as the\
  \ Old Man of the Desert, Shai-Hulud..."
