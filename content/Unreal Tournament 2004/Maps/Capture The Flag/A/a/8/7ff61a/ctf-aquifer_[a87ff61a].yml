description: "\"The ocean has its silent caves, Deep, quiet and alone; Though there\
  \ be fury on the waves, Beneath them there is none. The awful spirits of the deep|Hold\
  \ their communion there; And there are those for whom we weep, The young, the bright,\
  \ the fair.\"||\"Calmly the wearied seamen rest Beneath their own blue sea. The\
  \ ocean solitudes are blest, For there is purity. The earth has guilt, the earth\
  \ has care, Unquiet are its graves; But peaceful sleep is ever there, Beneath the\
  \ dark blue waves.\"|| -Nathaniel Hawthorne||"
