description: "This outpost is an old Skaarj facility bought by the Liandri Mining\
  \ Corporation in order to use in the Tournament, as part of a deal with the Skaarj\
  \ empire. In exchange, the Liandri would provide machinery and manpower to the Skaarj\
  \ empire. This won't be your usual face-to-face Capture The Flag arena, since there's\
  \ an enemy at any corner. Watch out!"
