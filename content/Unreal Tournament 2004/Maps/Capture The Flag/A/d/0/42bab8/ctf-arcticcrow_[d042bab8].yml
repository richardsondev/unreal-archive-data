description: "Stationed at 24,000 feet and veiled behind blinding fog and constant\
  \ snow, Arctic Stronghold provided the perfect place to conduct unsanctioned military\
  \ experiments for use against the Skaarj. Restructured for CTF, this arena allows\
  \ several paths to your enemy, and countless paths to death for the foolish or unwary."
