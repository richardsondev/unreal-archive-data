description: "AMOUDE.....The harbor temple of Anubis  basks in the early light of\
  \ a new day......20 long years have past since the death of the Great king Ihotep\
  \ who's passing was the catalyst for the civil war that raged across the upper Nile\
  \ between prince Imnet his son and natural successor and his brother Amatte the\
  \ one time admiral of the mighty Egyptian fleet...Amatte whose mindless cruelty\
  \ towards his own men led to his assassination and the succession of prince Imnet\
  \ as king of all Egypt.....Under King Imnet...... peace has brought great prosperity\
  \ to the upper Nile...But at a cost.....for jealous eyes now covet.....The great\
  \ wealth of Egypt and only death destruction and sorrow will follow!"
