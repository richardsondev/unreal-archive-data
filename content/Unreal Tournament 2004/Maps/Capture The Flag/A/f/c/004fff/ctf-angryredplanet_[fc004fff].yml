description: "This place was once a small mining facility owned by Liandri. It once\
  \ harvested many red ionic crystals until the native creatures who's purpose is\
  \ unknown took the facility by storm and killed all the workers, they were fierce\
  \ and relentless. Liandri wanted these creatures destroyed but could not get any\
  \ ships near enough so they came up with a plan and placed large sonic wave emitters\
  \ onto the planet. This did it's job, the creatures loathed the sound and drove\
  \ them mad but in doing so the crystals became fragile and blue in thier current\
  \ state and lost almost all it's worth. Will the Tournament gain any of Liandri's\
  \ money back? who's to tell."
