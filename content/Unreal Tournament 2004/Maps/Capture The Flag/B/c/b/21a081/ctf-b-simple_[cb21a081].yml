description: "This simple arena hasn't been bought or found by liandri, instead, they\
  \ created it. With walls resistant against the powerfull weapons in the arena, and\
  \ forts protecting the flag. The simple hill in the middle with the cover providing\
  \ blocks is excellent to snipe on and the sides can be used to sneak to the side-entraces\
  \ of the cyber-castles. || Simple. | Have fun storming the castle!"
