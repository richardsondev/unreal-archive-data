description: "Although the asteroid of BX9 is one of the most isolated in the galaxy,\
  \ it is strategically located between two warring planets and is a key control point\
  \ in the solar system. ||Both planets built a bunker on the small asteroid.  In\
  \ these bunkers supplies were stored, intelligence was gathered -- and attacks were\
  \ planned and carried out. ||100 years after the wars ended, Liandri bought the\
  \ asteroid and renovated the area.  It now serves as a popular Capture the Flag\
  \ arena."
