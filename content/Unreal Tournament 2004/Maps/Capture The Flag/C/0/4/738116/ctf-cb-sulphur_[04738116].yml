description: "The Sulphur Station is the refueling depot for the the large Sucupira\
  \ deposit mining operation, which has only just recently been decommisioned.  Noxious\
  \ fog, fills the lungs and strains the heart.   The money making enterprise of the\
  \ Tournament has filled the now empty mine with the ore of slaughtered combatants\
  \ - all under the silent watch of Sucupira's red moon."
