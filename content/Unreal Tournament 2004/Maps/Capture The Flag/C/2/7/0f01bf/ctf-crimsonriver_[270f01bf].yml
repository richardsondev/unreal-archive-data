description: "Once inhabited by nomadic tribes that constantly fought for the domination\
  \ of the river stream, Crimson River was flushed of all its occupants by the NEG,\
  \ who later abandoned the idea of its use as an ion defence post due to soldiers\
  \ being pummeled down-stream. Soon after a Liandri scout recognised potential for\
  \ the land. Two months later and the arena claims more lives than death himself."
