description: "The world's tallest buildings, built just recently, are not used as\
  \ office buildings. People found that out when they went in and found nothing but\
  \ a seemingly endless flight of stairs leading to the roof, nearly ten thousand\
  \ feet in the sky. A great way to keep the chaos up there out of the city floor\
  \ below, though the falling bodies are still a problem.."
