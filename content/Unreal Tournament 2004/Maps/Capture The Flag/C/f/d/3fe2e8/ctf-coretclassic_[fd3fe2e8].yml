description: "Once a refine factory, the Coret Facility was the first non purpose\
  \ built arenas to be purchased and converted by the Liandri Corporation, for the\
  \ then new battle tournament that was being planned back in 2301. A testing ground\
  \ for the tournament it soon won over the crowds and players alike and to this date\
  \ the original is still in constant use by the UT Vetrans.  Now, four years on the\
  \ new Coret Facility has moved to a new location on the Phobos Moon having been\
  \ completely rebuilt and redesigned to cater for the new faster flow of the new\
  \ tournaments."
