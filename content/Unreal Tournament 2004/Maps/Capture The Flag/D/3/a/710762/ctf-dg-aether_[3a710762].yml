description: "Long ago, when time began and the universe was first taking form, the\
  \ kingdoms of the elements of Earth and Air had made a truce and existed together\
  \ in peace for countless millenia.  But warring continued between the kingdoms of\
  \ the elements of Fire and Water.  Fire did persist to scorch Water, and Water held\
  \ on to its power to extinguish Fire.  Fire and Water believed that the winning\
  \ kingdom would rise to be the fifth element: Aether."
