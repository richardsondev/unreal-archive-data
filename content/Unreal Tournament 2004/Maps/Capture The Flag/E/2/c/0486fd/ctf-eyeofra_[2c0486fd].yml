description: "Built in ancient Egypt for the sole purpose of determining the fiercest,\
  \ most brutal and prominent warrior to become the new servant of Ra.  This Arena\
  \ was meant to be destroyed after the competition finale but was buried instead....The\
  \ whereabouts never discovered until recent excavations stumbled upon the almost\
  \ pristine arena.  Now, uncovered after centuries, The Arena is again open to claim\
  \ the lives of more arena fighters."
