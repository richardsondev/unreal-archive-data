description: "A Shadow shall fall over the universe, and Evil will grow in its path,\
  \ and Death will come from the skies. These are the words inscribed on the Temple's\
  \ Portal before you. This ancient keep was accidentaly discovered on a routine geological\
  \ survey mission and was immediately seized by the military. The glyphs tell of\
  \ an Ultimate weapon of infinite power stored within the lightning pyramid. Upon\
  \ the realization of this temples hidden secret, the industrial military branch\
  \ of the Liandri Corp. was commisioned to excavate and retrieve this awsome weapon.\
  \ The team was never heard from again. Several attempts and several hundred lives\
  \ later the operation was abandoned. Apparently it was not time yet for this weapon\
  \ to reveal its true nature. It was therefore decided by the Liandri Corp. that\
  \ in order to cut their financial losses the site should be converted into a new\
  \ venue for most popular bloodsport in the universe. Needless to say the Tournament\
  \ sponsors were delighted at the prospect of recouping their 875 billion credits.\
  \ For the last 97 years major clans have been battling each other amidst these Ancient\
  \ tombs. Each team must strive in an effort to be the first to claim superiority.\
  \ The team that wins will earn a chance to open the Crypt containing the ultimate\
  \ weapon. So long as both teams continue to fight niether will be able to retrieve\
  \ it. Keep in mind thought for nearly 100 years no one has succesfully managed to\
  \ unlock its secret. Since you = disgrace to the UT community, you should have no\
  \ problem with this."
