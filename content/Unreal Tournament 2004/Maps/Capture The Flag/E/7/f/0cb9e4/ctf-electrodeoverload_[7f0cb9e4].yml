  \ ENTRY                     Damn it, I told Remus this arena was too dangerous.\
  \ Now I'm stuck with a contract for 20 matches. This place gives me the spooks.\
  \ Shit, not even the techs have any idea what it was used for, let alone how to\
  \ turn it off. As if I don't have enough to worry about with Gorge running the flag\
  \ for the Blues, now I have to keep clear of those damned electrodes. All this unleashed\
  \ power makes my skin crawl.......Note to self: Purchase new rubber soled boots.\
