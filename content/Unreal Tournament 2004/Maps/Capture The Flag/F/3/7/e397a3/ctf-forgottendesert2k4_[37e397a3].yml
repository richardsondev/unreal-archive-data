description: "When archaeologists discovered this massive ruin of egypt 2 years ago,\
  \ Liandri knew it was well suited for the tournament. A Liandri scout was placed\
  \ within the group doing the excavating and funding, thus the area was handed over\
  \ to Liandri and used for tournament purposes."
