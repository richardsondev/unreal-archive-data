description: "Deep in the mountains of Granica, two miles north of Argento del Alma,\
  \ lies the isolated geothermal facility Gralada, operating with minimal human intervention\
  \ under the supervision of a program known as The Priestess. Housed in metallic\
  \ statues, The Priestess has been rumored by visiting engineers to send cries for\
  \ freedom echoing through the plant's empty passages. Thankless as it is, however,\
  \ the Priestess is unswerving in her task of maintaining Gralada's perpetually producing\
  \ power."
