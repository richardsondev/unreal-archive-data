description: "Hurstoria was built a long time ago, by the ancients, scientists believe\
  \ that it was the first human sewage plant constructed. Now, most of the sewage\
  \ is gone, the bare facility remains, Liandri purchased it for the Ancient Arenas\
  \ Tournament Scheme. After a more detailed excavation, it was discovered that the\
  \ sewers stretch further than once imagined, Liandri snapped up the new areas to\
  \ make an extended arena"
