description: "Gelu was once a warm, lush planet and its river system was harnessed\
  \ for an hydroelectric scheme to support a new colony.  But Gelu has a long period,\
  \ highly elliptical orbit and as the planet moved inexorably toward aphelion, the\
  \ global temperature plummeted. Gelu's water was trapped as ice thereby rendering\
  \ the hydroelectric facilities inoperable and the colony was abandoned.  Now one\
  \ of Gelu's frozen hydroelectric facilities is the latest CTF arena for Unreal Tournament."
