description: "The universe as we know it seems to be gone since long and you are trapped\
  \ in this weird black something that seems to be an interdimensional gap. However,\
  \ the Tournament continues. Why? Noone knows. It could be the joy of killing and\
  \ the impossibility of dying for good in this weird gap, which leads to just one\
  \ conclusion: There is no other form of entertainment but to kill each other and\
  \ steal the flags that survived the transition! But after an immeasurable period\
  \ of time, weird things started to happen. The combatants fell through holes and\
  \ all of the sudden, everyone left the arena that they celebrated Christmas on just\
  \ to fall onto another kind of arena, which faces a huge purple whirl. It appears\
  \ to be some sort of portal, that seems to destroy this environment. Where does\
  \ it lead to? Why is it there? Does it cause the instabilities? Could it lead to\
  \ a new dimension, a better dimension, one that looks and feels like your old one?\
  \ There is just one way to find out... But first, it is time to capture some flags!\
  \ - Happy Halloween!"
