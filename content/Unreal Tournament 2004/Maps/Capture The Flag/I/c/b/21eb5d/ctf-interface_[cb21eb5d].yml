description: "The Liandri Corporation has for a long time been on the lookout for\
  \ new arenas for their unreal tournament. When the heard about a water processing\
  \ plant on Mars that as the result of an accident had been evacuated, they were\
  \ fast to buy it. It turned out was the perfect setting for their popular capture\
  \ the flag matches. Today this arena is one of the most feared. Because of its small\
  \ size, it's often host to some of the most intense and brutal battles in an attempt\
  \ to safely bring the flag back,"
