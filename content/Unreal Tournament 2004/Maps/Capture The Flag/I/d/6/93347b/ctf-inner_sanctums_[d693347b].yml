description: "...and furthermore!  Would you believe we found the REMAINS of a couple\
  \ of FLAGS in the rubble?  I don't think this is the first time the place has been\
  \ used for our purpose.  Yeah, I KNOW it's really old.  You should see some of the\
  \ gadgets we found down here guarding the Sanctums...and they still work!  I know\
  \ because the stupid workmen found an old lever that they promptly pulled...and\
  \ broke.  Before I knew it half of the labor force was either stomped, speared,\
  \ dismembered or boiled.  That reminds me...please send more workers.  Thanks!"
