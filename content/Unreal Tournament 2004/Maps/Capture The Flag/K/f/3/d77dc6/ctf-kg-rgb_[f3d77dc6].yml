description: "RGB gas processing facility was never in red numbers. Owning company\
  \ - RGB United - can't know what the problem is because Rubingas and Bigryum are\
  \ extremely valueable. And RGB United is also the only company who posses the secret\
  \ of how to trasform Garnitum into these two precious substances. | Transformation\
  \ process however requires regular breaks at night... and here came the Liandri\
  \ with the idea to use the facility for their bloody sport. RGB facility is well-suited\
  \ for CTF because of its shape. And spectators love to see people falling into the\
  \ Garnitum too.  | Of course - Tournament Lease for night costs something... and\
  \ yes, RGB United really can't know what the finacial problems are about."
