description: "The two great nations, finally at peace after centuries of war, devised\
  \ a plan to create a monumental structure utilizing their skills of architecture\
  \ and hydro-electric energy. A tragedy occured before it was completed, the vision\
  \ was abandoned, and the nations went back to war. Hundreds of years later the monumental\
  \ complex is now housing a glorious competition, in hopes of reuniting the nations\
  \ and finally bringing about peace once again."
