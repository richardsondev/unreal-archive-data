description: "No one knows how these empty train cars move across the desert, but\
  \ it is well known that they are a perfect way of getting around. Originally, getting\
  \ aboard one was impossible, simply because they never stop moving. But a fusion\
  \ of Gen Mo'Kai and human technology has changed that. Now, fast-moving stations\
  \ circle the desert cities. From this close range, poeple can be teleported to the\
  \ stations to board the trains connected to them. One of these stations has been\
  \ converted into an arena. Normally, force fields prevent you from falling off,\
  \ but they have been removed...so watch your step! A section of it was blasted off\
  \ recently, but it was automatically replaced with an invisible forcefield bridge;\
  \ be careful, though, because it won't stop enemy bullets! The jet trams are useful\
  \ for escaping pursuers. The truck carrying the power crystal has not only a superweapon,\
  \ but a nice sniping spot. If you're feeling daring, turn away from your flag base\
  \ train as you leave the spawn train and jump into the puddle for the most insane\
  \ way of getting around you've ever seen! And if you wish to reach the central island\
  \ platform, you must ignore your fear of falling..."
