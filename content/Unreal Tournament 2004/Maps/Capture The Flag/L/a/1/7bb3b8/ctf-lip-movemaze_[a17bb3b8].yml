description: "After the high ammount of deaths on the moving maze, LIP-Rampage said\
  \ was going to make a remake in some time of the first one, a better move maze,\
  \ but, he dont made, so what happened?A guy that fighted on the arena is waiting\
  \ for the remake, surely was not the first one, now, here is the Move Maze 2, of\
  \ the same style of the arena DM-Curse 4, but the only difference is that the walls\
  \ of this one moves and you can be crushed."
