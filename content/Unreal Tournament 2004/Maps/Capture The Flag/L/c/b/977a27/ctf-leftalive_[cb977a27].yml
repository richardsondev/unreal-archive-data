description: "A regional dispute between the competing Blue and Red clans on your\
  \ home planet Quarxos escalated into an all-out war when the leaders of each side,\
  \ who had cooperated to create a rare peace for the last generation, were brutally\
  \ murdered during a bilateral conference.  Bored young tempers flared, and the pent-up\
  \ rage from the 7-year lapse in violence will be released here, tonight.  Which\
  \ side will leave alive?"
