description: "The liandri Corporation has come across a poisons and acidic planet\
  \ on sector B-1939.  This planet was once thought to be of no use in till the operatives\
  \ of Liandri flew in to see a structural anomaly.  This Anomaly ended up being a\
  \ skyscraper just passed the vast stream which was the name of the acidic clouds\
  \ down below.  This skyscraper holds very little history of what could have happened\
  \ on this world.  All we know is that the Liandri corporation has be mystified why\
  \ the posters on the walls read in English as opposed to another language.  The\
  \ civilization must have been connected to the people on Earth.  This is also oddly\
  \ connected since a huge statue close to the skyscraper holds a globe of Earth.\
  \  We can have two assumptions that either this planet was like Earth geologically\
  \ or Earth somehow influenced these people. Very little knowledge was un covered\
  \ on this vast building, liandri Corp has theorized that this planet was once in\
  \ a great war of some kind and that the acidic remains are proof of this."
