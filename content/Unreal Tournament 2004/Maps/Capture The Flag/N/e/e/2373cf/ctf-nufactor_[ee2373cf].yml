description: "In the early 22nd century, humans began exploring the edges of the second\
  \ quadrant. In their never ending search for Dylithium, fuel for their AntimatterInjectionWarpEngines,\
  \ they completely drained and almost destroyed quadrant 1 .On a moon orbiting a\
  \ class Alpha planet, the crew of the Panodra Star discovered an incredible amount\
  \ of Dyalith, The raw material from which Dylithium is made. So, they build a Dyalith\
  \ refinery and called it Nufactor. Not long after producing the first results the\
  \ crew discovered they where not alone.  A highly advanced alien race suddenly emerged\
  \ from the depths of space and captured the crew to use them in their sick and deathly\
  \ game: UT2k4. Now the people of the Pandora Star are cursed to spend their entire\
  \ live capturing other prisoners flags and respawn eternally for the amusement of\
  \ the Tokk'hies, as the advanced alien race call themselves."
