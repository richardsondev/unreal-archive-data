description: "Welcome to Niven Experimental Labs ][ Special Edition... || || An experimental\
  \ orbital nuclear reactor sitting in an Earth - Moon lagrange point. || Advanced\
  \ quantum singularity power sources provide enormous amounts of power and have allowed\
  \ the facility to expand way beyond it's original design. The tournaments still\
  \ have access to the labs as the station inhabitants insisted their favourite form\
  \ of entertainment continued. The combatants now find that the arena has expanded\
  \ and includes the twin air processing plants in addition to the reactor core. ||\
  \  || Original UT version - Alan 'Talisman' Willard || This version - John 'SylverFyre'\
