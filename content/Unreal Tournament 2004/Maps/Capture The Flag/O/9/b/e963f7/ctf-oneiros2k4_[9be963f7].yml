description: "Some connections are made to be discovered, while others should remain\
  \ unseen. Some lands are best never spoken, as their hell lies in between. The words\
  \ ring in the mind like a dream with irony not lost.  For Oneiros is simply that,\
  \ the dream city of forgotten souls.  Governed by none but watched by many."
