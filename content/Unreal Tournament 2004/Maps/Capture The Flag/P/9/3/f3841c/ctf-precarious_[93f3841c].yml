description: "After the war left billions dead and their planet nearly uninhabitable,\
  \ the Ven'ra and Cyldaens have finally called a truce.  But hatred, fear, and prejudice\
  \ still fester between these rivals.  The Ven'ra refuse to reveal the purpose of\
  \ this secret facility and insist it is for peaceful purposes only."
