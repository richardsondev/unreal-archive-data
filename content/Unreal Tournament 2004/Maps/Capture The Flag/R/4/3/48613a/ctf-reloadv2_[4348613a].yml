description: "Inspired by the Matrix movies...CTF-ReloadV2 was designed as a fast\
  \ action map for 10-16 players. I designed this map with the LGI 135/35 community\
  \ in mind but it can be played in all weapons mode just as well. Please enjoy this\
  \ contribution and look for more unique maps coming soon from {TDC}Clan! Check us\
