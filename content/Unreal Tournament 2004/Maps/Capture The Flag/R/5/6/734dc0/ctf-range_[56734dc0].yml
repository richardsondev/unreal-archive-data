description: "This place is actually not a temple at all. It is not ancient, nor is\
  \ it built by any ancient civilization. It was constructed not long ago by the Casey\
  \ Mcdonald movie productions company for a big action adventure hit named System\
  \ Flaw. Casey, a major fan of the tournaments, sold the set at his own will to Liandri\
  \ corp for nothing but pure enjoyment of getting to see new action adventure being\
  \ worked into the area without his help. He donates a good sum of money every year\
  \ to keep the arena intact."
