description: "Welcome to Rell, where the sparks fly and combatants die! Buried deep\
  \ in a mountain crevice, the structure survived the firy nuclear firestorm above,\
  \ but the government to sustain it did not. Now this decomissioned plasma engine\
  \ manufactuary once again rings with the sounds of white-hot lightning arcs and\
  \ clattering shrapnel, but for a different reason, and now the sole product of this\
  \ forgotten place is death. Enjoy your stay!"
