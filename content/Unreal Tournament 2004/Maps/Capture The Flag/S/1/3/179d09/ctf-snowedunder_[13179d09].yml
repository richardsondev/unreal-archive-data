description: "In this cold, harsh and frequently snow-swept valley, only the strongest\
  \ combatants survive. The double-facility base was once a remote supply outpost,\
  \ which ceased transmitting due to a raid by a rogue Skaarj Blood Hunter hit squad.\
  \ This proved ample inspiration for the tournament scouts, two of whom had been\
  \ there at the time and survived to have the base rebuilt as an arena."
