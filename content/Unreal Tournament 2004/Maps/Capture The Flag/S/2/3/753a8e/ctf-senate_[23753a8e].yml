description: "Mortals are not told what purpose serve the Premakan giants, the angry\
  \ gods of the automatons, in their mechanical senate, as they work in deathly silence\
  \ inside the empty halls to accomplish the emperor's will. Only those who are destined\
  \ not to come back are allowed to venture near the cores of the reactors, to fight\
  \ for two glorious rags, battered relics of a glorious age, an age of blood and\
  \ gold."
