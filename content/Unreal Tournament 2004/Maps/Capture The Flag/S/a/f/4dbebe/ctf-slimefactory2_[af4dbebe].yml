description: "This map is a tribute to the very first Unreal Tournament map I created,\
  \ which was Slime Factory. Although I doubt most have ever seen the original creation\
  \ you will note that they only share a couple things. Theme, Name and of course\
  \ Author. I hope you enjoy Slime Factory II."
