description: "A couple hundred years after the Stargate program was founded, Liandri\
  \ finally had enough money to buy the base as a tournament hot spot, they then travelled\
  \ to the  planet LJF-6741, which they then cleared out the area and use the acient\
  \ and desserted ruins as a playing field. Using a new power source, Liandri has\
  \ been able to keep the wormhole stable for the whole game."
