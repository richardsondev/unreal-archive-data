description: "Eons of dormancy bely the nature of violence that erupts daily in this\
  \ ancient volcanic cone.  Located in the center of a vital antimatter research facility\
  \ in the Saroma system, this field is host to two native, opposing factions, each\
  \ struggling for control of the galaxy's most modern containment facilities.  On\
  \ days when the twin suns are both in view, the steam rising from the ground is\
  \ of a crimson tint, and tastes salty-sweet, thick with the blood of battle.  Welcome\
  \ to the Decane Caldera..."
