description: "n\x0fA rather small and insignificant planet in the vicinity of Plural\
  \ ZZ Beta has recently gained immense popularity among tourists and Tournament fans.\
  \ As expected it wasn't the dog**** weather that kept the people's interest and\
  \ no, they didn't come for the golden glowing dirt either:||What attracted them\
  \ was the successful execution of a government's plan to build and establish an\
  \ arena for the Tournaments in order to bite off the cake of their immense financial\
  \ success. An old and utterly unremarkable underground temple structure was found,\
  \ lazily restored and given a made-up historical importance due to the role it supposedly\
  \ played in some obscure events involving an alien race that sounds suspiciously\
  \ like random letters. The arena made some headlines when several warriors were\
  \ killed by poisonous spiders living down there so the Liandri Corp. bought the\
  \ now scandalous and therefore profitable arena and made it the one and only highlight\
  \ of the planet!||||Built by: Tobias 'Murphy' Pimmer"
