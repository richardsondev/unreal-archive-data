description: "The \"Eagle\" labyrinth was one of several sites of ancient ruins found\
  \ on a planet named Hylia. It was named \"Eagle\" after its unique shape, which\
  \ resembles that of an eagle with outstretched wings.||Liandri redecorated things\
  \ a bit, and this has become a well-liked tournament venue."
