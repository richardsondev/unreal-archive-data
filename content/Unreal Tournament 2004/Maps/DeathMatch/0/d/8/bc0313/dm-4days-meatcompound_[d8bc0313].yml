description: "In the earlier years this area was a torture chamber for captured war\
  \ victims. After the war it was used as one of the largest meat supply locations\
  \ on the planet, until the meat factory was closed down for the contamination of\
  \ meat products. Citizens who ate meat from this factory often became ill and some\
  \ paralyzed."
