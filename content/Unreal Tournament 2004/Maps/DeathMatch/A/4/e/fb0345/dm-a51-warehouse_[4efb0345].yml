description: "Back on Planet Earth, a certain secret military base, dubbed Area 51,\
  \ was thought to be lost forever. Recently, an excavation team uncovered what was\
  \ thought to be just another warehouse filled with ancient nonsense... that is until\
  \ they saw the large 51s painted on its walls. Inspection of the crates stored there\
  \ proved that the technology that once existed has long since been surpassed. Control\
  \ was turned over to the Tournament and plans were immediately underway to add this\
  \ Area 51 warehouse to the ranks."
