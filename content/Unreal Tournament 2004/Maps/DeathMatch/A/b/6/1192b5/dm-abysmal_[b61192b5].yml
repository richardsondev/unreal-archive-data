description: "When humans had first begun to spread across the galaxy like a swarming\
  \ plauge, the crude science of terreforming otherwise inhospitable planets was a\
  \ huge industry. In the race to come up with a quick solution, the GAIA factory,\
  \ also known as a mega-plant, was born. These factorys would use the air and soil\
  \ as a medium to produce the life giving materials found on Earth. Water, air, and\
  \ every other element was produced to create life where none was thought possible.\
  \ In a rather bad turn of events, it was discovered that attempting to shut down\
  \ the GAIA stations would result in an apocolyptic explosion however, and the mega\
  \ plants were forced to run 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, endlessly producing a\
  \ weather system that, in the end, almost remained just as catastrophic. Entire\
  \ planets soon began to flood, or worse, fall off their rotational paths and fall\
  \ abysmally to their doom into the nearest sun. Only one planet was saved from such\
  \ a fate, because only one of the GAIA stations had been built on it, keeping the\
  \ effects to a minimum. Although the planet has suffered sever flooding due to constant\
  \ rainfall, and most of the land is now eroded away, there still exists few small\
  \ islands and of course, the mega plant itself. The people behind the endeavor went\
  \ into hiding, nobody knows where, or who even had come up with the idea in the\
  \ first place anymore, basically putting all of the mega plants out of bussiness.\
  \ The last one was taken over by the tournaments, since obviously, nobody else would\
  \ even go near the place."
