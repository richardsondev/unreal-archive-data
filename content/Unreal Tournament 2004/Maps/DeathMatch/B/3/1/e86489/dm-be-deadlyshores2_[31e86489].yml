description: "Shortly after Liandri took on this arena and started the tournaments,\
  \ strange sounds where heard at night.| |They believed what they heard to be the\
  \ ghost's of fallen shipmate's roused from there slumber by the screams of dying\
  \ champions.| |Ontop of that there where now sharks attracted by the blood of champions\
  \ and the abundant numbers of tropical fish in the water.| |Liandri sure do like\
  \ it when there arena becomes more treacherous all on its own....| |This map was\
  \ named by Jeff-Mr.UglyPants-Zingeler."
