description: "Created on an ateroid by a rich scientist for his own viewing pleasure\
  \ of the tournament.  Why did he build a tower on a layer of magma?  Nobody knows.\
  \  He now calls the asteroid bounce, and loves to watch tournament fights on it.\
  \  And now you get to be part of it...  Music by Bodyrox (Remixed by D Ramirez)"
