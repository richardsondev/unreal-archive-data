description: "This is a REVISION of the map DM-BackyardDD2, a remake of the original\
  \ \"DM-BackyardDD\" made by {SdK}DoctoR DeatH. (For more of his maps visit www.utmc.com.)||You\
  \ and your foes have shrunken the size of a midgeot and got stranded in someone's\
  \ backyard, in the middle of the night. The weather reports weren't good, so the\
  \ rain and thunder have already begun.||NOTE: This map has NO low gravity, and is\
  \ meant to be played without any low gravity mutator (like LowGrav), unlike most\
  \ of the giant maps. If you have to, go right ahead, otherwise remember to keep\
  \ your shieldgun close when you think you might risk a fall. It can be a good friend\
  \ when you need it.|Enjoy!||  --  Aquablue  --"
