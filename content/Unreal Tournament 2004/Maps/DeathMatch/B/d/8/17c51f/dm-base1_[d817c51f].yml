description: "Outer Base is the first level of Unit 1 from|Quake 2. It is short and\
  \ simple - helping the player get used to the game's controls and combat.||The game\
  \ begins right next to Bitterman's crashed Drop Pod in a devastated room. The level\
  \ features a main corridor, a small outdoor yard, and a sewer-like area filled with\
  \ Water. Other parts of the level include a dark crawlspace leading to the sewer,\
  \ a large, less-damaged room with several crates, and a heavily damaged storage\
  \ area, in which most of the roof has collapsed.||The level's ambience is very dynamic\
  \ - the sounds of flying ships and distant explosions can be heard constantly. It\
  \ appears that the Base complex is being intensively bombed by Terran Coalition\
  \ of Man forces.||The player's goal in this introductory level is simple - find\
  \ a way to the exit elevator and gain access to the Installation. Along the way,\
  \ they can pick up a Shotgun, Grenades and a few other useful items."
