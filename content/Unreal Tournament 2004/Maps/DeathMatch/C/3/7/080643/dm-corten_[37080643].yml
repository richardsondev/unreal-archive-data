description: "Despite polls showing most audiences would rather watch matches taking\
  \ place in real-life locations, ratings show people actually prefer games played\
  \ in arenas built from the ground up to fit the requirements of their favourite\
  \ bloody sport. With the blessing of corrosion-resistant materials, new areas are\
  \ built to look like recognizable places, but with the added benefit of amazing\
  \ sights."
