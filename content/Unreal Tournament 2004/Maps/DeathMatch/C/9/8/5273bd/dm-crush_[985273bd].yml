description: "Deep in space is where you can find these two lost arenas  linked together\
  \ by the Gods.  Time has no meaning here, this is where Gladiators come to find\
  \ they're battle.  Crush got its name from the hidden traps that gladiators can\
  \ activate and use to their advantage.  Be ready for battle when you enter the arena,\
  \ its time to get it on!!!  Good luck and have fun, your gonna need it.  This is\
  \ a {RYTS} Toke and Smoke Production.  If you like this map, you can always swing\
  \ by and play it on our server."
