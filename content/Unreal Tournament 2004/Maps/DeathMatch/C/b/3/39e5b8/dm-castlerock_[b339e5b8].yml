description: "CastleRock exists on a far planet called Psion Moon. There was only\
  \ one way on, and one way off... Anyone trying to escape was killled on sight. The\
  \ \"Rock\" as it's called contained 3000 inmates below the huge castle's floors.\
  \ All were on death row waiting to die for their crimes. A deal was made for Liandri\
  \ to step in and revamp the facility to not only produce molten, but also give the\
  \ inmates a choice to fight for their freedom by playing the Tournament. The only\
  \ catch was... If you won, you lived! If you lost... well, then you die!"
