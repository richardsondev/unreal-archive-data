description: "This now ancient base, located on a shelf about halfway down a deep\
  \ sea trench, has served it purpose. No longer needed, the scientists left for home\
  \ and the government authorized an auction for the facility. In the current state\
  \ of things, it's obvious to see who made the highest bid. This base is not without\
  \ danger however. The pressure of the water squeezing in on this place is encredible,\
  \ and the only way in and out is a submarine. Due to the extreme depth of this facility,\
  \ traversing to far into the water will result in a pressure related death."
