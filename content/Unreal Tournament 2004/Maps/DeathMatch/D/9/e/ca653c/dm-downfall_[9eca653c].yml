description: "The Lucria sewer strut 16-B began malfunctioning some time ago. The\
  \ damage caused by exploding toilets was immesurable, and the cash required to repair\
  \ the strut was unimaginable. However, a tremendous donation came from an undisclosed\
  \ benifactor, on the condition that the tournaments now be held withen the strut.\
  \ With their Radio Antenna also owned by the Tournament, it is commonly wondered\
  \ how long it will be untill the entire city is just one big arena..."
