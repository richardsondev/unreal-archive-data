description: "The year is 2034 and NACHO Inc. has developed a new technology based\
  \ on the properties of an black hole/event horizon. Nacho Inc physicists utilize\
  \ localized-black-hole-technology or LBH-Technology to create energy. Virtual particles\
  \ are always paired; normally virtual particles annihilate each other but at the\
  \ even horizon of a black hole one virtual particle is lost resulting in an actual\
  \ particle being deposited outside the event horizon. This particle then becomes\
  \ free energy. So in essence energy can escape a black hole. It is this union of\
  \ virtual particles and black hole forces that has enabled the creation of free\
  \ energy by Nacho Inc."
