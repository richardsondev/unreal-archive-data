description: "Watch your step in this arena. All you have to stand on are descending\
  \ elevators that will drop you to your death, so you better keep moving.  Learn\
  \ to use the different features of the environment to keep you as far away from\
  \ the flames as possible. What is the good news about not having a safe place to\
  \ stand? No Campers!"
