description: "The result of a public poll carried out by the Liandri-Rules-Board was,\
  \ that many of the Tournament-Fans wanted to see the old arenas again. So many of\
  \ them were brought back to life but the Fractal Reactor wasn't safe enough!||So\
  \ the Fractal Reactor #2 was built by Liandri to bring once again the Tournaments\
  \ to a really classic Deathmath-Arena!"
