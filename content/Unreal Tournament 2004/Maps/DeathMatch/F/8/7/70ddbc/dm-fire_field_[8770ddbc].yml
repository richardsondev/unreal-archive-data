description: "Battle it out inside the now abandoned area 71. This area was used extensivly\
  \ during the corperation war. The strike team from lanandri defeated there rivals\
  \ after a major siege. This map is based upon what was left behind. Before the records\
  \ of the area were permently erased they indicated that the area was used to syphon\
  \ power from magma. So expect to get a hot foot."
