description: "When you see geese heading south for the winter flying in a \"V\" formation,\
  \ you might consider what science has discovered about why they fly that way. As\
  \ each bird flaps its wings, it creates an uplift for the bird immediately following.\
  \ By fling in a \"V\" formation, the whole flock adds at least 71 percent greater\
  \ flying range that if each bird flew on its own. People who share a common direction\
  \ and sense of community can get where they are going more quickly and easily, because\
  \ they are traveling on the thrust of one another. Finally--and this is important--when\
  \ a goose gets sick or is wounded by gunshot, and falls out of formation, two other\
  \ geese fall out with that goose and follow it down to lend help and protection.\
  \ They stay with the fallen goose until it is able to fly or until it dies; and\
  \ only then do they launch out on their own, or with another formation to catch\
  \ up with their own group."
