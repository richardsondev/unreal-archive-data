description: "One of the oldest human cities to still exist given the name in honor\
  \ to one of the best and deadliest tournament fighters.. Gaia.                 \
  \      Large city divided into 4 parts and joined together by bridges and underwater\
  \ tunnels.                           Recently this old peaceful city has become\
  \ the landmark for illegal matches where rich and powerful people bet for their\
  \ favorite fighters, the police is aware of the situation and are ready to take\
  \ action. You are now standing in Corner A of Gaia,      what lies beyond that very\
  \ bridge depends on you........"
