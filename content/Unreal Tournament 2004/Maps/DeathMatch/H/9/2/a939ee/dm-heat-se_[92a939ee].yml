description: "After the great success of Rankin, the audience wanted more industrial\
  \ maps. So a famous architect was hired to construct a new Arena. 2 years later,\
  \ the constructions on the planet AV-79 had to be canceled because of problems with\
  \ instable ground. The new place, where the Arena should be built, was the neighbour\
  \ planet AV-70. This planet was a lot hotter, so there had to be cooling devices\
  \ installed that were not planed by the architect. After 3 years, the Arena was\
  \ finished at last and could be opened for the tournament."
