description: "This map was originally conceived by {~ICF~}NAPALM.  He passed the idea\
  \ along to me and we both agreed it should have an Edward Scissor-hands feel to\
  \ it.  Perhaps I got a bit carried away.  The base for this map came from [MPC]-Butt-o-ween.\
  \  The original castle design came from JB-Castlebreak.  This map has a lot of playable\
  \ area. I built this one with matrix moves and ZARK assault rifles in mind.   Also\
  \ thanks to |EVO| AsToRoTh for all his map building help."
