description: "The peaceful planet of alestra. It was once beautiful full of nature\
  \ and life. But just like any healthy planet it also came with an enormous amount\
  \ of resources. The liandri mining corporation soon moved in and slowly devoured\
  \ the planets beauty. Now all the remains is a barren wasteland full of fire and\
  \ ash."
