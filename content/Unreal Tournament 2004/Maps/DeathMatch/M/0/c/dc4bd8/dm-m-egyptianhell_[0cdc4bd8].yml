description: "Ra was once the king of all egypt during his time. During his time of\
  \ rule he became feared due to his evil practices. Ra loved to watch people fight\
  \ to the death....It then became his time to die, but instead of going to Heaven\
  \ he was sentenced to Hell for eternity. Ra was actually enjoying himself and some\
  \ how managed to take control of Hell..........After Ra had control he decided to\
  \ build himself an arena for all the sinners to do battle. Ra loved these battles\
  \ so much that he kept an everlasting eye on his arena (Literally)......So battle\
  \ away, Impress Ra, you might just get lucky enough to escape the Nightmarish Tomb!!!"
