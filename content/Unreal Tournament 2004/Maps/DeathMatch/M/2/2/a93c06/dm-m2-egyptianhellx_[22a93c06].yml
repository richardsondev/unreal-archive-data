  \ they came by the millions. Warous knew it would not be possible to stop or defeat\
  \ this attack, but he still ordered all of his men to asttack, and he him self went\
  \ and hid in his chambers. The battle lasted all of 2 minutes at most and Warous\
  \ could here foot steps coming towards him. The warriors found him anfd took him\
