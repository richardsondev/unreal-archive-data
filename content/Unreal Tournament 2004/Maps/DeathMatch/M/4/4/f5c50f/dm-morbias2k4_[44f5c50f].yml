description: "Welcome to the Firehawk-59 Nuclear Missile Facility. The self-sustained\
  \ mainframe that controlled the nuclear launches suffered a severe malfunction and\
  \ is now critical. The computer's security system went haywire and it does not allow\
  \ it to be turned off. A huge air conditioning device is working full time to prevent\
  \ the extremely unstable mainframe to overheat and launch the devastating warheads.\
  \ Such a dangerous environment was an ideal setting for the Liandri Corporation\
  \ to setup a Tournament arena that allowed for some furious nuclear gameplay. NOTE:\
  \ This map is better played with gamespeed set to 1.2 or higher (access via Gamespeed\
  \ Mutator)"
