description: "This mysterious temple was found during the journey of Columbus when\
  \ he returned from America.  The story goes that when Columbus and his crew entered\
  \ the temple a lot of them disappeared mysteriously. There is an old Inca tale that\
  \ says that the temple was home of the power of the gods, and that anyone who wanted\
  \ to steal this power, will be sent straight to hell and he will be tortured for\
  \ 1000 years."
