description: "The first arena built for the tournament was deemed too clumsy and a\
  \ trip hazard, causing several lawsuits against the Liandri Corporation. The architect\
  \ was killed in a freak redeemer 'accident' and the arena closed down. Years later\
  \ the arena was re-opened as a reminder of what not to do."
