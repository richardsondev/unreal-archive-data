description: "Tahhara, the once vibrant merchant town in the Sari Desert, has long\
  \ been abandoned.  Left to rot, worn by the winds, scorched by the sun, and slowly\
  \ being swallowed by the sand, this desert town was almost lost forever when, by\
  \ a miraculous chance, it was discovered by  the Liandri Corperation.  Since then,\
  \ it has become a popular battlefeild for those seeking a more urban enviorment."
