description: "Once the jewel of the Liandri distribution network this station fell\
  \ into disuse, along with thousands of others, when Liandri switched all of its\
  \ resources over to its most profitable enterprise, the Tournament. Interestingly\
  \ enough, due to the materials used in its construction, this station looks as good\
  \ as it did when it first opened more than a century ago. It has recently been recommissioned\
  \ for use in the in the Tournament and has been given a new name, [P4L]KillZone."
