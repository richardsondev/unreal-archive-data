description: "This compact facility was originally an underground bunker built by\
  \ the Zorn Clan.  It was initially designed to function as a headquarters, and is\
  \ able to withstand nuclear and biological attacks.  Once the Zorn were eliminated,\
  \ Liandri seized the opportunity to claim the structure as a battleground for the\
  \ tournaments.  The creed of the Zorn Clan can still be found inscribed somewhere\
  \ in this facility."
