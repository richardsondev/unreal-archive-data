description: "This so-called 'impenitrable' fortress was built by a group of medieval\
  \ monks to store their most sarced relics and artifacts. Fate had other plans, as\
  \ weeks before the reliquiary was to be finished, every last monk was slaughtered\
  \ by a wandering horde of barbarians. If you listen closely, you can hear their\
  \ haunting souls crying out to this day..."
