description: "After a routine fly over the jungles of na pali, a Axon research scout\
  \ ship found this skaarj fortress, which was abandoned when they left the planet.\
  \ After long research into the complex they discovered the fortress is in fact the\
  \ holding place of a super weapon, a weapon which could destroy targets on the planets\
  \ surface or in its orbit within seconds. However no weapon was ever found, but\
  \ Axon Research has now unlocked the sercrets of the skaarj technology and they\
  \ believe they have also located the skaarj's homeworld. With all research now exhausted,\
  \ Axon Research sold the fortress onto Liandri for tournament use."
