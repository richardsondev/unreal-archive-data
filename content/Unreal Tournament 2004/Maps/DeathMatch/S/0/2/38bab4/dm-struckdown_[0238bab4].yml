description: "This arena was once the home of a proud race...until the rains came.\
  \ As a global climate change took over the world, they did their best to accomodate\
  \ the never ending storms that pounded the planet. In the end, the waterways, causeways\
  \ and waterfalls proved worthless and they were forced to abandon their home. Now\
  \ the property of the Liandri Corporation, this arena has been fitted for first\
  \ class deathmatch. Jumppads, modern lighting that comments the planets naturally\
  \ lit plantlife, and added architecture have turned this rain drenched planet into\
  \ one of their finest arenas. However, even Liandri can't stop the rain ;)"
