description: "This vacant factory is located on earth on a little hill, its owners\
  \ changed steady. At last, they wanted to buit a rocket-testing bunker in it, but\
  \ because of the many reconstructions, there were nothing but difficulties and at\
  \ least the same number of accidents at the construction process. Instead of closing\
  \ the factory and to demolish the whole building, Liandri bought it, where now tournaments\
  \ are being fighted on three Levels."
