description: "X\x06One of the main facilities constructed in the early 21st century\
  \ to harness the searing heat and energy of magma, this deathmatch arena offers\
  \ intense heat, but fortunately for the competitors, there is little chance to taste\
  \ it. Environmental hazards are kept at a minimum via lava covering walkways and\
  \ grating systems, leaving the competition solely between the competitors in a super-heated\
  \ environment."
