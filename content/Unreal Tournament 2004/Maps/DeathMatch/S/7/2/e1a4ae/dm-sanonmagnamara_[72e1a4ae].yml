description: "For aeons the traditional rite of passage for Tequan boys was conducted\
  \ in a purpose-built arena that served to honor the god of war. The event was held\
  \ as a competition between 6 youths, each one from a tribe rivalling one of the\
  \ others. One was judged to have succeeded when they had sought out their rival\
  \ and sent them plummeting from the boardwalk to the rocks rimming the pool below.\
  \ After this the youth was required to make a leap of faith into the shallow pool\
  \ itself in order to complete the ceremony. As a result of the prestige associated\
  \ with making the dive to the pool, a legend grew that the waters themselves instilled\
  \ one with great fortitude. With the temple itself now being used as a theme arena\
  \ in the Liandri tournament, competitors will have a chance to test the legend."
