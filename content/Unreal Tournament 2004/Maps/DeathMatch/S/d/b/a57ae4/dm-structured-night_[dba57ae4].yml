description: "Structured... at night! Once a facility used to service the Liandri\
  \ Mining Corporations underground operations, it came into disuse many years ago\
  \ after a major breakthrough in technology left it redundant. But after the metal\
  \ was polished and the wood was sanded, it returned to its former glory, and became\
  \ a popular new tournament venue."
