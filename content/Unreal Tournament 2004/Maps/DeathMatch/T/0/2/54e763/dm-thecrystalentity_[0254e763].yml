description: "First discovered by the forest people of Tebulan 10000 years ago. The\
  \ Crystal Entity lies in a cave in the beautifull icy valley of Bujaran high in\
  \ the Upper Harijan Mountains, home of the Ice faerie Lilliana. For hundreds of\
  \ years  the people of Tebulan would carry there sick and injured from far below\
  \ in there forest city of Anitek up into the cave to use the magical healing powers\
  \ of the Crystal Entity. When the evil Draken Trolls of Garbon heard of the Crystal\
  \ Entity a violent struggle to gain control of the cave raged and the forest people\
  \ were being slowly wiped out. To end the violence and to stop the Draken Trolls\
  \ from gaining control of the Entity, Lilliana blocked the only entrance to the\
  \ valley with impenetrable ice shards and she used the magical Icicles given to\
  \ her by Icobin the ice sprit, to forever stop any of the crystals being removed...."
