description: "Bradford's stunning art gallery was opened in 1904 with an important\
  \ collection of Victorian and Edwardian works following its donation to the city\
  \ by Samuel Cunliffe Lister.||The hall, surrounded by a first rate park offers something\
  \ for everyone.||Exciting temporary exhibitions plus permanent art collections,\
  \ including 20th Century British Artists are on display.||The UT2003 version of\
  \ this map was my submission to PC Format Magazine's 'Design a UT2003 level and\
  \ win a PC' contest. (PC Format Issue 154 - November 2003)||UPDATE: My map won 1st\
  \ place in the aforementioned contest and I received a new computer as the grand\
  \ prize. In addition, I was invited to the UK to visit Cartwright Hall in person.\
  \ I will take the trip later this year (2004). During my visit I will take reference\
  \ photos and measurements for an updated version of this map! Visit my website below\
  \ for more information as it becomes available.||Website|---------||www.funrealtournament.com|"
