description: "Due to global warming and the massive melting of fresh water from the\
  \ polar ice caps. The oceans convection currents can no longer carry warmer air\
  \ to the northern hemisphere, thus creating a rapidly advancing ice age. This once\
  \ beautiful lake park with its majestic walkways, castle structures and foliage\
  \ are now reduced to collapsing ruins.The hot springs are now an icy sludge. Listen\
  \ closely and you will hear the faint echoes of this once thriving world. With a\
  \ glimmer of light from the hazy blue skies the solar lighting remains functional,\
  \ leaving one last use for this freezing basin: Liandri Domination Tournament."
