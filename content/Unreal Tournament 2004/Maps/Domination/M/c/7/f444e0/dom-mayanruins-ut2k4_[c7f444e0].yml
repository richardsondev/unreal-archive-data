description: "As the evening light slowly fades away behind the mountains, the surrounding\
  \ jungle undergrowth begins to come alive with the sound of natural wildlife. The\
  \ once isolated Mayan Ruins nearby also come alive, with the sound of echoing gunfire\
  \ and the piercing screams of the dying, as another competition in the Tournament\
  \ gets underway..."
