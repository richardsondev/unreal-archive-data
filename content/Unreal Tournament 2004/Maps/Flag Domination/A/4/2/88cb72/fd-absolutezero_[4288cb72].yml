description: "Absolute Zero was initially constructed as a scientific outpost to study\
  \ glacial drift. Over the years, global warming and massive earth tremors nearly\
  \ shook the base off of its foundation. The researchers and scientists were hastily\
  \ evacuated and Liandri quickly purchased the base for the tournament. The warm\
  \ reception given to you by your team may help offset the sub-zero temperatures,\
  \ but don't get too comfortable, your foes have something much colder in store for\
  \ you..."
