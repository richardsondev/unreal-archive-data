description: "Under the new city of Lemarge there still lie old sewers, now redundant\
  \ due to new recycling facilities, only populated by rats and other vermin, it's\
  \ stagnant water and the smell of bad air are the only things that were found in\
  \ the place, until it was discovered by the Tournaments.|| 'and deep down nobody\
  \ hears your cries... in the Underground'"
