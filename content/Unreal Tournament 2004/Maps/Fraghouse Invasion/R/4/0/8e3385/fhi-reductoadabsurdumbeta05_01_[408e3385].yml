description: "When the moon is low in the East, so will the many hordes come.||And\
  \ they will be led by their Queen.||And she will lead the Assassins and the Brutes.||And\
  \ the Titans will shake the Earth.||And the Guardians will strike at the Teddy Bear\
  \ Empire.||There on that darkling plain will the Mercenaries follow, seeking gain\
  \ from chaos.||And in his desert fastness, Emperor Horatio Bear will wait.||Alone,\
  \ save Tom Bear and a few good bears...||For so it is written, for so it is written.||\
  \ ||And yet, and yet, this story shall the good bear teach his son;||And Bear Day\
  \ shall ne'er go by, from this day to the ending of the world, but we in it shall\
  \ be remembered.||We few, we happy few, we band of brothers; for he today that sheds\
  \ his blood shall be called brother;||Be he ne'er so vile, This day shall gentle\
  \ his condition;||And gentlebears in Bearland now-a-bed,||Shall think themselves\
  \ accurs'd they were not here,||And hold their bearhoods cheap whiles any speaks,||That\
  \ fought on this Bear Day."
