description: "Late in the war, the Skarjj mounted a sudden attack on Earth's main\
  \ Jovian base.||In order for the attack to succeed, the Skarjj had to disable the\
  \ generators powering the base shields.||The attack was well planned and the Skarjj\
  \ soon held the cliffs above the Generator Complex||Taken by surprise, only a handful\
  \ of brave Earth forces were left to hold the base's Generator Complex.||The inner\
  \ doors are sealed but if the Skarjj take the Main Hangar they will soon break through.\
  \ ||We don't know if a message got through before the Skarjj started jamming our\
  \ transmissions.||Hope that re-enforcements are on the way! | | Jovian image courtesy\
