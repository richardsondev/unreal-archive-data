description: "Arlon was a secret Research and Processing facility found unfinished\
  \ and abandoned by Liandri Corporation. The facility was later converted to a Jailbreak\
  \ arena when the salvage team mysteriously disappeared. Wide open and built for\
  \ action, this prison is a favorite of tournament fans.     FragBU Edition: Execution\
  \ sequence changed as lockup workaround."
