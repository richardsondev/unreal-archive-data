description: "This great, mythical metropolis may have sunk to the darkest depths\
  \ of the ocean, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's off limits to the Tournament.\
  \ Even though it's located 20,000 leagues under the sea,  through unknown Atantean\
  \ powers emanating from strange crystals all over the city, Liandri Corporation\
  \ ensures that competitors won't get so much as a toe wet unless they don't watch\
  \ their sixes and end up in the tank.  Liandri Corporation loves the huge amount\
  \ of cash this self powering arena and killing ground is saving them.  Time to kick\
  \ some butt or can you drink the Atlantic? JB version by AcydBurn, Gold by INIQUITOUS."
