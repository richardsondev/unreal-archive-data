description: "The Sliths may be hard and cruel, they know their economics. They force\
  \ their N'bachai (Slithian for both 'prisoner' and slave') to build their own prison\
  \ with little more than what they can find, on places where natural resources can\
  \ be mined. Once the prison is complete, it serves as both their habitat and their\
  \ working environment.||Re-R'Dch, nicknamed Fragtion, is the most infamous of these\
  \ prisons. Located 50 feet below the thick wilderness of N'robi, it's one of the\
  \ very few spots where both natural gas can be mined and the roots of the huge N'robi\
  \ trees can be crafted into planks. The working conditions are extremely rough,\
  \ but the guards don't allow slackers..."
