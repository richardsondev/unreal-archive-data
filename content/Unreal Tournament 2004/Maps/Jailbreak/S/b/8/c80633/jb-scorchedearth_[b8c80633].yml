description: "The stench of brimstone fills the air, as sulphurous clouds move overhead\
  \ and lava bubbles menacingly below. The thick layer of rust on the remaining structures\
  \ provides dubious protection for the metal ravaged by the many corrosive agents\
  \ that poison the atmosphere. The environment is as lethal as the competition, making\
  \ for one unforgiving battleground."
