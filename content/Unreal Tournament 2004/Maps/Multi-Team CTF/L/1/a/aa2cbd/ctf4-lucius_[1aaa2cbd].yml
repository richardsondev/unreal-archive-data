description: "This map is one of the older new arenas, originally constructed by the\
  \ architect who goes by the title of Claymore. The arena was constructed in the\
  \ last days of the old tournament. As the new tournament was scheduled to begin\
  \ soon after it's release, the public did not see much of the Lucius pit. Now, as\
  \ we enter the final days of this seasons tournament, the arena is released to the\
  \ public again, remodeled by The Iron Knuckle. Soon the arena will be forgotten\
  \ again as the excitement of the new tournament kicks in. But one day the ideas\
  \ will re-emerge.More and more arenas will be produced. And when that day comes,\
  \ the mighty Lucius Pit shall rise once again."
