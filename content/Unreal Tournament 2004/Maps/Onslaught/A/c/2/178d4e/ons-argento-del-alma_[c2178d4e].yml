description: "The planet Taron's only hope of survival was because of these great\
  \ two spires that threw acids into the air to create the greenhouse effect that\
  \ Taron has developed till now.  These terra-forming plants were once threatened\
  \ by the Hellion forces, but with the swift hand of the NEG this schema was stopped.\
  \  The remains of the convoy carrying the Nexus missiles still remain in this sandy\
  \ graveyard as a reminder of what could have happened.  Now these two terra-forming\
  \ plants have been discontinued and have been retrofitted to be a solar power plant\
  \ for nearby towns.  The Liandri has bought these grounds for small controlled warfare\
  \ named Onslaught that has appeared in the new Tournament for the upcoming year.\
  \  Taron's goes into a hibernation state every decade when the plants start alignment\
  \ with the Sun Krandura.  The axis of Taron changes ever so slightly and affects\
  \ the atmosphere; though one of the curiosities of this planet yet another surprise\
  \ is of a sponge like plant that grows dramatically quick to struggle against this\
  \ change of the atmosphere.  This plant has been known to grow 8 feet in a day.\
  \  This plant now named the guru plant is a spectacle to behold, especially since\
  \ these plants have light emitting bulbs. This axis change lasts for two years,\
  \ if it was not for these plants Taron would not be fit for human habitation even\
  \ with the efforts of terra-forming."
