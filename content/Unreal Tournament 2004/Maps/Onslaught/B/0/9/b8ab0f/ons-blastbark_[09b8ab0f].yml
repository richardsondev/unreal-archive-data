description: "The Blastbark Canyon is located in the wilderness of the Ennveld on\
  \ the exposed side of Planet Deix. The winds that come howling through the gorge\
  \ daily are enough to whittle any exposed fauna to a husk. Life can only be found\
  \ hidden away in crevasses in the hot rock. The plants in the valley have adapted\
  \ to the point where they are able to bloom in the short hours between dust storms\
  \ to take in the rays from the planet's five suns. Anyone unlucky enough to find\
  \ themselves here as part of the Tournament's Onslaught event would want to ensure\
  \ a quick victory, or else risk having the skin peel from their bones in the swift\
  \ boiling wind."
