description: "This island is sucking the life out of me. Fighting on the beaches of\
  \ this island saps my strength and diminishes my will to fight and survive. I lost\
  \ a good friend down near the trench on the beach today - Ill miss him a lot.  He\
  \ wont go on to fight another day.  With all this fighting and with no end in sight,\
  \ makes me wonder if it is all worth it.  Im picking myself back up off the beach\
  \ again, I can feel the blood and sweat pouring off my brow.  This sand wedged between\
  \ my teeth sure leaves a bitter taste in my mouth."
