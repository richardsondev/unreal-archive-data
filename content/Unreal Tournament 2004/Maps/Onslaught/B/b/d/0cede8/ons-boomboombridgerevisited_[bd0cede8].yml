description: "This is a mystical fortress where the legendary mapper Hobi-Wan created\
  \ some of his greatest levels.||Sadly, this fine artist swam in what is now known\
  \ as Hobi-Wan's Lake of Doom and washed away his will to build levels.||All we have\
  \ left now is Boom Boom Bridge, which is perhaps the best example of his craftsmanship.\
  \ We pay tribute to Hobi-Wan with a true onslaught map that we hope somehow approaches\
  \ the level of his mastery. ||"
