description: "The planet Taron's only hope of survival was because of these great\
  \ two spires that threw acids into the air to create the greenhouse effect that\
  \ Taron has developed till now.  These terra-forming plants were once threatened\
  \ by the Hellion forces, but with the swift hand of the NEG this schema was stopped.\
  \  The remains of the convoy carrying the Nexus missiles still remain in this sandy\
  \ graveyard as a reminder of what could have happened.  Now these two terra-forming\
  \ plants have been discontinued and have been retrofitted to be a solar power plant\
  \ for nearby towns.  The Liandri has bought these grounds for small controlled warfare\
  \ named Onslaught that has appeared in the new Tournament for the upcoming year."
