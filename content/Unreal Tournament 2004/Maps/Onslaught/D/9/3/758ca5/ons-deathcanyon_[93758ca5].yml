description: "Since a long time the LC is searching for the ultimate battlefield.\
  \ During the examination of a unknown planet, the LC discovered a canyon. The first\
  \ time when they were there, it was very scary, because everywhere in this canyon\
  \ were destroyed vehicles. The number of these destroyed vehicles was very high.\
  \ Liandri was searching for the answer, why these vehicles were there and destroyed.\
  \ After a lot of examinations, the LC found out, that this was a unit, which was\
  \ sent by Liandri to this planet to discover it, but these was something. When the\
  \ unit was on this planet, everything was good, but suddenly the unit sent a emergency\
  \ signal to the headquarters of Liandri, but it was very short. Liandri sent a Elite\
  \ Unit with some scientists to this planet. After this informations they still didn't\
  \ know who destroyed their unit. Suddenly the LC found a survivor and he told, that\
  \ the unit was destryed by a very big unit of Necris, that was really unexpected,\
  \ because this, Liandri gave this Canyon the name DEATH CANYON everything there\
  \ is dead, so watch out."
