description: "This abandoned water tank was once part of a functioning water treatment\
  \ facility in the heart of the desert. When it shut down, the complex was bought\
  \ out by tournament officials and converted into a popular spectator arena. However,\
  \ the forgotten subterranean sectors of the facility were rediscovered and this\
  \ arena was neglected. It is now mainly used illegally by rival clans for more unofficial\
  \ matches."
