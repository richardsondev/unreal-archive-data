description: "This massive platform was designed to terraform planets unable to sustain\
  \ life. Primarily, it was built during the planetary crisis caused by over polluting\
  \ the planet and desalinizing the oceans. Humanity needed a last resort, and this\
  \ was it. Nicknamed Lolkhiem after the scientist who thought of it, it quickly fell\
  \ into disuse once it was no longer needed, and the scientists on the team of constructing\
  \ it fell into a trillion dollar debt to the government who had funded the project.\
  \ In a means to pay their way back into civilization, they sold it the only people\
  \ crazy enough to fire rockets and drive tanks across its many walkways..."
