description: "It was just old battlefield, changed into new ONS arena. On the center\
  \ of map there is building, where some time ago were founded new weapon techniques.\
  \ Propably now it will be good thing to control if one of team wants to win. It\
  \ was used during the war of United  Corporations and NEG against Necriss in 2369.\
  \ Here was created such things like Leviathan or Redemer, even Nexus missiles. Now\
  \ it turned to be another Onslaught arena."
