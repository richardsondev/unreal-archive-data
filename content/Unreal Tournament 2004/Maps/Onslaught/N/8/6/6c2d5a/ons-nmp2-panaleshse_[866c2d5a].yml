description: "t\rAs new and inhabitable worlds are discovered at a rate of five a\
  \ month, a lot have races that live or have lived on them. Panalesh contained a\
  \ race that is believed to have become extinct only recently and most think this\
  \ is the work of the infamous Skaarj. This was confirmed when huge quantities of\
  \ Tarydium deposits were discovered which gives a definite objective for the Skaarj,\
  \ and Liandri even bought the whole planet. Whilst performing extensive mining on\
  \ most of the planet and fighting off Skaarj and Izanagi strike forces, this Tarydium\
  \ induced lake was saved just for the tournament Onslaught matches due to its size.\
  \ The Lake Mynolor site or Watcher of the Sky, settled amongst the Kreenook spire\
  \ mountain range was perfect for a large Onslaught map. And seriously tests the\
  \ combatants team management and cooperation.||www.third-helix.com||bradley.jones@kilkenny.ath.cx"
