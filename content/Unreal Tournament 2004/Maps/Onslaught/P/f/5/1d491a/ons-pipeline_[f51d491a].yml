description: "During the second water war on Hell's Gate IV, your forces have pulled\
  \ up a heavily fortified commando point near one of the major wells which feed the\
  \ planets capital pipeline. Controll over this region would ensure a sufficient\
  \ quantity of fresh water for your people that would last for years, while at the\
  \ same time effectively cutting most other factions from the supply line. Unfortunately,\
  \ the enemy did once again foresee your actions, and if it wasn't for the viscious\
  \ sandstorm scourging the dry plains, you could almost see the enemy war-khan prepare\
  \ for an open assault on your fortress..."
