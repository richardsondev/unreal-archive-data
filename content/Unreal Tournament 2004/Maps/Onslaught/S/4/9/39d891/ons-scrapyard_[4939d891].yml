description: "Due to the strict budget of Liandri in recent years, you will be fighting\
  \ in a junkyard that was once a formidable Onslaught arena in itself. Any attempt\
  \ to leave this cheap arena will be met with the ioncannon floating in space. Will\
  \ you emerge from this cheap wasteland victorious or will your body only contribute\
  \ to the mess?"
