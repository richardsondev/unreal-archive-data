description: "Professor Vayo,  ||You must leave your studies of the Spotted Wildebeest\
  \ on planet Zarvox and join me in Egypt.  The nuclear winds from the recent test\
  \ bombings have exposed a site that will forever change the textbooks of extraterrestrial\
  \ archeology.  We have found ruins that appear to have been built by the Nakhti\
  \ thousands of years before the Great Pyramids.  At first we thought it was a second\
  \ 'Valley of the Kings' but our research of the hieroglyphs tells a different story.\
  \  Apparently the ancestors of the Nakhti royalty would stage territorial battles\
  \ that pitted teams of warriors and mercenaries against one another to decide who\
  \ would claim the crown of Pharaoh.  The exact terms and conditions of the victor's\
  \ reign are somewhat vague.  All we have is this partial translation: 'Rest here\
  \ are (damaged section) King of the (undecipherable) Ser- (damaged) ver- (missing\
  \ section) victory belongs (broken section)'.  Another tablet found in the northern\
  \ temple is believed to either be a treatise on weapon refinement or perhaps eating\
  \ utensils.  Several statues depict a previously unknown god of warfare whose name\
  \ we believe to be either 'M' rox' or 'B' ork'.  As you can imagine we have spent\
  \ much time debating the exact translation.  ||Come quickly.  Mother will prepare\
  \ a fabulous feast and I'll have young Norbert fetch you one of the genetically\
  \ engineered desert llamas from the stables.  ||-Dr Reginald P. Fragonious III"
