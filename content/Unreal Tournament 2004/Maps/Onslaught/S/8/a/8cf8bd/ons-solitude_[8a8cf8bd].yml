description: "This once entirely oceanic planet was the victim of Liandri Corporations\
  \ new super-accelerated terraforming process. The single island that now rises from\
  \ the sea floor, surrounded by endless water, was originally supposed to be a lush\
  \ and tropical environment. But something went wrong, and what rose from the sea\
  \ floor was an abomination of lifeless material. However, a high-ranked member of\
  \ the Liandri Corporation saw potential, and started sketching on how they could\
  \ still create an interesting environment with minimal work. Some weeks later, this\
  \ artificial Onslaught arena stood complete. And as a bonus, the terraforming process\
  \ caused the sea floor to break open throughout the planet, and veins of acidious\
  \ gas leaked out into the water, wreaking havoc with the eco-system."
