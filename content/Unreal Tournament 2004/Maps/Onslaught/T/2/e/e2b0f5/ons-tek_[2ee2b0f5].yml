  \ Onslaught gametype. The staff like in all other condition are not affected by\
  \ the temperature of this planet , wich is 3 times harder to tolerate from earth's\
  \ top degree radius. The only thing that live in this planets are crawling  creatures\

  \ small , but they eat everything that still live in this planet."
