description: "Most people know about the final battle between the Skaarjs and the\
  \ Humans when they successfully destroyed the Skaarj's mothership in a final desperate\
  \ attack. But few people know how the Nali people fell to the Skaarj ground shaking\
  \ troops 20 years before the Great Skaarj / Human War. Although a pacific race,\
  \ the Nalis had built mighty fortresses in the Great Nali Canyon to protect themselves\
  \ for agressors. But when all Skaarj legions attacked the Great Nali Canyon, the\
  \ Nali just couldn't match with the Skaarj cutting edge technology. Outnumbered,\
  \ they resisted for 3 months before finally falling to the Skaarj's Leviathans.\
  \ Most Nalis were either brutally slaughtered or enslaved and sold throughout the\
  \ Skaarj empire. This is how the epic story of their fall ever made it to our knowledge,\
  \ thousands of years later. You will have the great opportunity to participate in\
  \ the re-creation of the epic battle. IMPORTANT NOTE : It is recommended to disable\
  \ the \"swap team after each round\" parameter in the server options when playing\
  \ this map."
