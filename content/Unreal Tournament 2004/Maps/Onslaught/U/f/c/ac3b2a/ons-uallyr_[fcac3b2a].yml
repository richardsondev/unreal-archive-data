description: "Thousands of years ago, two pharaohs and their immediate families were\
  \ buried in facing tombs on opposite sides of a small lake in the Uallyr valley.\
  \ Over centuries the worlds temperature dropped quickly, the lake froze over and\
  \ the stone of the tombs turned blue as a thin layer of frost spread over it. At\
  \ sunset the ancient torches are relit for combatants fighting man against man -\
  \ without vehicles, in one of the tournaments oldest arenas."
