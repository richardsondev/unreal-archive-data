description: "Space Communications Outpost Torpedo 1 was the first of the faster-than-light\
  \ satellites to enter Earth's orbit. These satellites moved at the highest of speeds\
  \ to enable the ability to send data from anywhere in the world to everywhere in\
  \ the world, all at once. The first faster-than-light engines were unstable, and\
  \ shortly after launch Torpedo 1's engine imploded, leaving the station stranded,\
  \ gradually slowing."
