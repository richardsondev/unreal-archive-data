description: "When the scouts were scouting out locations for the next tournament\
  \ they found these two military bunkers, they were astonished. both bunkers were\
  \ perfectly intact, power still flowing through the cables and wires to the various\
  \ black budget research projects burried deep under the permafrost. it was as if\
  \ everyone just evaporated. It isn't known how long its been sinse these outposts\
  \ last saw battle but it won't be long before they see it again."
