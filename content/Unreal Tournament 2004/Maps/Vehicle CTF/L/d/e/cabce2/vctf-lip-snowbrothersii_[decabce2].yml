  \ skaarj ship, after the sucess escaping with an accident on the ship, they come\
  \ down to this cold canyon, where have no nalis here, so, they decided to make their\
  \ two house in the canyon and be the first nalis to alive here, after some months\
  \ they finshed, stayed here until their deaths, like will happen to you, if you\
  \ enter here, just exit dead.But LIP-Rampage dont made a perfect map when Liandri\
  \ ordered him, now, return the version 2 of the deadly arena, now without Hellbenders\
  \ and with some new details, like the planks at the middle to get the Redeemer,\
  \ now the secret is not more an Insta Gib shock rifle, now there have a Redeemer,\
  \ a Ion Painter and a AVRiL instead of the Super Shock Rifle, because some people\
  \ started to think that get it was a cheat, so, it was cutted off."
