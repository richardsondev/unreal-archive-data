description: "Abandoned after a revolt resulted in the execution of its sadistic commander,\
  \ this now quiet mining facility contains an echo of the notes of discord sung by\
  \ its ill-fated workforce.||When Liandri returned to the site after losing contact\
  \ with its managers, the triumphant crew was irradiated from space.  Now deemed\
  \ safe from insurrection, all equipment of value has been removed.||The moonlight\
  \ reflects serenely from the odd glass panel, but players rarely reflect on the\
  \ sad irony that left this mine ideally suited for tournament competition."
