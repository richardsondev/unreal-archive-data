  \ to be an ancient ring was found floating in space. When salvagers arrived they\
  \ were shocked to find that what had appeared to be a metallic object was covered\
  \ on one side with flora and other foliage, they found abandoned bunkers and even\
  \ waterfalls and ice.||The Liandri corportaion decided to buy the ring and use an\
  \ area of it for a new arena."
