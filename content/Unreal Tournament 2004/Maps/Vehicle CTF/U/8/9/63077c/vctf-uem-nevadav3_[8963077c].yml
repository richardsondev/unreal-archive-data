description: "In a area of egypt, at a unknown place, two bases are facing till death.\
  \ Nobody did every know this place until somebody of the holy guard found it. Today\
  \ it is just a tournament arena like many else, but the old tradition and dead warriors\
  \ are still there. Their souls and minds are not lost, only their bodies. Keep your\
  \ eyes open or you will be the next one."
