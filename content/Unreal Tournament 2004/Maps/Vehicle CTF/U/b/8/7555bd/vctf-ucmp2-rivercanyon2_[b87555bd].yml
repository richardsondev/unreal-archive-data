description: "Once a large cave carved out of the rock, this canyon holds the ruins\
  \ of a civilization, it's name lost in time. Eventually, the river flowing through\
  \ the city flooded and the pressure razed the cave ceiling as well as the civilization\
  \ itself. The canyon seems calm and peaceful at first glance, but the murderous\
  \ river is willing to tell it's dark story, more than once again..."
