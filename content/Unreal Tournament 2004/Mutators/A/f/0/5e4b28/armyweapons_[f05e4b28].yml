    \ Shotgun, RPG-7, M24 Sniper, M82 Sniper||Configure mutator to set which weapons\
    \ to use, method of replacement and other options.||v3.5"
weapons:
- name: "Frag Grenades"
  description: "Frag Grenades are powerful explosives with a large explosion radius.\
    \ They have three second fuses which can be 'cooked' off before throwing by holding\
    \ the fire button. Cooking a grenade too long will result in your injury or death.\
    \ Grenades can also be exploded by weaponfire and explosions. Primary fire throws\
    \ them full strength, secondary fire throws them at half strength. The Frag Grenades\
    \ are difficult to use well, but are very deadly when they are timed right."
- name: "M249 SAW"
  description: "The M249 SAW is an automatic rifle that is fairly accurate for its\
    \ very quick rate of fire, but it has heavy recoil. This is a powerful close-range\
    \ weapon."
- name: "M24 Sniper"
  description: "The M24 is a single-fire sniper rifle that must recharge between shots,\
    \ which takes 2 seconds. It has a 5-round chamber which takes over 4 seconds to\
    \ reload. It has pin-point accuracy, and little recoil. Secondary fire operates\
    \ the high-power scope. This sniper rifle is preferred by those who only want\
    \ to shoot once per target."
- name: "M4 Rifle"
  description: "The M4 is an automatic rifle that fires fairly quickly and is quite\
    \ accurate. It takes about 2 seconds to reload its 30-round clip. It has moderate\
    \ recoil. The attached M203 grenade launcher fires impact-detonated 40mm grenades.\
    \ This is a good all-around weapon. The tournament version of the M4 is light\
    \ enough so that players can wield two M4s at once, to double the fire rate. However,\
    \ it also doubles the reload time and lowers accuracy. Still, dual M4s are a force\
    \ to be reckoned with."
- name: "M82 Sniper"
  description: "The M82 Barret is a semi-automatic sniper rifle. It has a 10-round\
    \ clip which takes about 3 seconds to reload. It's accuracy is almost dead-on,\
    \ but it has heavy recoil. Secondary fire operates the high-power scope. This\
    \ sniper rifle is better for quick multiple snipes."
- name: "M870 Shotgun"
  description: "The M870 is a single-fire pump-action shotgun. Due to the wide spread\
    \ of the pellets, it is quite limited in range, and has heavy recoil. At close\
    \ range where most of the pellets will hit, this weapon can quickly eliminate\
    \ any target."
- name: "RPG-7"
  description: "The RPG-7 is a launcher that fires rocket propelled grenades which\
    \ move very quickly and deliver high damage. Reloading another RPG takes about\
    \ two seconds. This weapon can effectively take out targets medium range."
