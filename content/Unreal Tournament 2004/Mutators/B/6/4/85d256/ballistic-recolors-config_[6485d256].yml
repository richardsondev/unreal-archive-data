- name: "A49 Skrith Blaster"
  description: "A49 Skrith Blaster||Manufacturer: Unknown Skrith Engineers|Primary:\
    \ Rapid Energy Pulses|Secondary: Disorienting Blast||An interesting piece of Skrith\
    \ technology, the A49 Skrith Blaster seems to be an attempt at a miniaturized\
    \ A73 Skrith Rifle, to fill an intermediary role somewhere between that of a side\
    \ arm and full sized assault weapon, roughly equivalent to a human sub-machine\
    \ gun or sub-assault rifle. Its compact size and respectable power makes it considerably\
    \ better than its cousin, the A42 Whip, but an unexplainable lack of samples found\
    \ on skrith fighters, plus the weapon's unreliable rate of fire and tendency to\
    \ overheat suggest that this was an unsuccessful weapon that failed to see full\
    \ scale use. || The weapon's curious defensive light and sound based function\
    \ is capable of disorienting attackers at point blank, but its very existence\
    \ is brought to question by scientists and soldiers alike. Veterans of Skrith\
    \ assaults argue that Skrith would have no need of this function, often being\
    \ able to strike quickly without being seen. Researchers theorize that perhaps\
    \ this weapon was a mark of shame, given to skrith unable to remain hidden from\
    \ view of their enemy."
- name: "A73-E Skrith Rifle"
  description: "A73 Elite Skrith Rifle||Manufacturer: Unknown Skrith Engineers|Primary:\
    \ Energy Bolt|Secondary: Blade Stab||The A73-E is a specialized version of the\
    \ Skrith standard rifle and is rarely seen on the battlefield. Aside from the\
    \ red tint, the Elite model is very similar in appearance to the standard. Scans\
    \ show, however, that this special version fires projectiles at roughly 3 times\
    \ the standard heat level and has an odd permanent electrical charge coursing\
    \ through the blades. If encountered in the field, it is advised to report the\
    \ occurrence to HQ immediately for testing."
- name: "AH104 Assault Pistol"
  description: "AH-104 'Pounder' Handcannon||Manufacturer: Enravion Combat Solutions|Primary:\
    \ HEAP Rounds|Secondary: Laser Sight||'The handcannon of the future.' Those were\
    \ the words of Enravion as they publically released this modified version of the\
    \ AM67. Nicknamed the 'Pounder' for its potent .600 explosive armor piercing rounds;\
    \ the AH104 can legally carry the name handcannon. Its immense stopping power\
    \ and anti-armor capability make this weapon a favorite of military leaders and\
    \ personnel across the worlds. The full-steel AH104 is known to be absurdly heavy\
    \ (12 lbs unloaded) in order to compensate for the power of its large rounds and\
    \ cannot be dual wielded. It also comes equipped with a laser targeting system\
    \ in place of the usual AM67 flash bulb."

    \ alternative to the AH104, the AH208 is an alternate design chambered for .44\
    \ magnum rounds instead of the usual $100 .600 HEAP ones. It is less accurate\
    \ than the AH104 and D49, but its 8 round magazine and faster reload times let\
    \ it put more rounds down range than both. Its significant weight and recoil means\
    \ it requires both hands to shoot and is harder to control than its revolver and\
    \ handcannon siblings, a fact that comes into play where range is a concern. While\
    \ not as popular as its larger .600 cousin, the AH208 packs a formidable punch\
    \ and is a force to be reckoned with."

    \ Black & Wood's Bulldog was designed as an extremely reliable and high powered\

    \ of Cryon grunts at 50 yards and shattering enemy structures with relative ease,\
    \ the massive .75 caliber BOLT rounds devastate anything they smash into. Designated\
    \ 'thermoBaric Ordinance, Lead Trajectory', the acronym desicribes the payload\
    \ and trajectory of the massive primary munition of the Bulldog. The secondary\
    \ ammo feed can be chambered with a number of different 20mm rounds, but the preferred\
    \ shells are an adaption of the potent FRAG-12 explosive slugs, used for ripping\
