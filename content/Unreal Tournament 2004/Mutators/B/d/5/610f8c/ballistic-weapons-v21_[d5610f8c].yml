- name: "Junk War"
  description: "Battle it out with whatever you can get your hands on! All manner\
    \ of junk is dotted around the arena, everything from rusted old pipes, crowbars\
    \ and spanners to ice picks, tazers and empty beer bottles, it can all be used\
    \ as a weapon... ||http://www.runestorm.com"

- name: "MRS138 Tactical Shotgun"
  description: "MRS138 Tactical Shotgun||Manufacturer: Drake & Co Firearms|Primary:\
    \ Single Shot|Secondary: Held Tazer Attack|Special: FlashLight||Also from the\
    \ first line of Drake & Co weaponry, the MRS138 Combat Shotgun, is an excellent\
    \ close-range weapon. Using 10 Gauge ammunition, this shotgun provides high damage,\
    \ medium spread, and more range than most other weapons in its class. Although\
    \ it has more range than other shotguns, the MRS138 has a slightly larger spread,\
    \ and due to the size of the pellets, does not fire as many. The weapon is also\
    \ outfitted with a tactical light, and tazer attachement, to increase its effectiveness\
    \ as a crowd control and civilian weapon. This shorter than usual shotgun, can\
    \ only house 7 rounds of its deadly ammunition, and unfortunately, must be cocked\
    \ after each shot. The tazer is an effective tool for stunning enemies and inflicting\
    \ slight damage, leaving them blinded and disoriented for a few seconds, while\
    \ the flash light can be used for locating those which hide in the dark."
- name: "RS8 10mm Pistol"
  description: "RS8 10mm Pistol||Manufacturer: Drake & Co Firearms|Primary: 10mm Fire|Secondary:\
    \ Laser Sight|Special: Silencer||A fine and reliable weapon, produced by a rather\
    \ new company, the 10mm RS8 pistol is bound for success. Featuring a 14 round,\
    \ 10mm magazine, laser sight and silencer, as well as an effective closer range,\
    \ 3-round burst fire mode. Use the laser sight to see exactly where your gun is\
    \ aimed, and the silencer when stealth and quietness are required. The RS8 being\
    \ a fairly recent firearm, first manufactured during the second-war, has not seen\
    \ as much action as other older pistols, and some critics say it won't be able\
    \ to stand up to a Cryon, let alone a Skrith!."
- name: "XRS-10 Machine-Pistol"
  description: "XRS-10 Machine-Pistol||Manufacturer: Drake & Co Firearms|Primary:\
    \ Medium .40 Cal|Secondary: Laser Sight|Special: Silencer||The XRS10 is a small,\
    \ silencable Sub-Machinegun, constructed by newcomer arms company, Drake & Co.\
    \ Based on a design from many years ago, the XRS10 is a short, medium-range weapon,\
    \ using .40 calibre ammunition. The weapon has a medium rate-of-fire, fair damage,\
    \ and a decent magazine capacity, yet can generate much recoil and chaos. The\
    \ new model, features silencer and blue-light laser sight, to give it some more\
    \ edge in stealthier situations."
- name: "SRS900 Battle Rifle"
  description: "SRS-900 Battle Rifle||Manufacturer: NDTR Industries|Primary: Powerful\
    \ Rifle Fire|Secondary: Activate Scope|Special: Silencer||Another battlefield\
    \ favourite produced by high-tech manufacturer, NDTR Industries, the SRS-900 is\
    \ indeed a fine weapon. Using high velocity 7.62mm ammunition, this rifle causes\
    \ a lot of damage to the target, but suffers from high recoil, chaos and a low\
    \ clip capacity. The altered design, can now incorporate a silencer to the end\
    \ of the barrel, increasing its capabilities as a stealth weapon. This particular\
    \ model, also features a versatile, red-filter scope, complete with various tactical\
    \ readouts and indicators, including a range finder, stability metre, elevation\
    \ indicator, ammo display and stealth meter."
