- name: "Target Painter"
  description: "The Target Painter, similar to the Ion Painter, fires a harmless,\
    \ low power laser with its primary fire. Unlike the Ion Painter, however, this\
    \ weapon calls in a bomber that launches a string of bombs in the direction the\
    \ user is facing, centered on the painted target. The bombs will easily incinerate\
    \ the target and any unfortunates that happen to be nearby."
