weapons:
- name: "Enhanced AVRiL"
  description: "The Enhanced AVRiL, or Enhanced Anti-Vehicle Rocket Launcher, shoots\
    \ homing missiles that pack quite a punch."
- name: "Enhanced Assault Rifle"
  description: "Inexpensive and easily produced, the AR770 provides a lightweight\
    \ 5.56mm combat solution that is most effective against unarmored foes. With low-to-moderate\
    \ armor penetration capabilities, this rifle is best suited to a role as a light\
    \ support weapon.|The optional M355 Grenade Launcher provides the punch that makes\
    \ this weapon effective against heavily armored enemies.  Pick up a second assault\
    \ rifle to double your fire power."
- name: "Enhanced Bio-Rifle"
  description: "The Enhanced GES BioRifle continues to be one of the most controversial\
    \ weapons in the Tournament. Loved by some, loathed by others, the BioRifle has\
    \ long been the subject of debate over its usefulness.||Some Tournament purists\
    \ argue that it is the equivalent of a cowardly minefield. Others argue that it\
    \ enhances the tactical capabilities of defensive combatants.|Despite the debate,\
    \ the weapon provides rapid-fire wide-area coverage in primary firing mode, and\
    \ a single-fire variable payload secondary firing mode. In layman's terms, this\
    \ equates to being able to pepper an area with small globs of Biosludge, or launch\
    \ one large glob at the target."
- name: "Enhanced Flak Cannon"
  description: "Trident Defensive Technologies Series 7 Flechette Cannon has been\
    \ taken to the next step in evolution with the production of the Mk3 "
- name: "Enhanced Grapple Gun"
  description: "Riordan Dynamic Weapon Systems combines the best of weapon design\
    \ in the Advanced Plasma Rifle v23, commonly known as the Link Gun.|While the\
    \ primary firing mode of the Link remains the same as its plasma-firing predecessor,\
    \ the secondary cutting torch has been replaced with a switchable energy matrix.\
    \ Upon contacting a teammate, it converts to a harmless carrier stream, offloading\
    \ energy from the onboard cells to boost the output of any targeted player also\
    \ using the Link.|It should be noted that while players are boosting a teammate,\
    \ they are unable to defend themselves from attack."
- name: "Enhanced Lightning Gun"
  description: "The Enhanced Lightning Gun is a high-power energy rifle capable of\
    \ ablating even the heaviest carapace armor. Acquisition of a target at long range\
    \ requires a steady hand, but the anti-jitter effect of the optical system reduces\
    \ the weapon's learning curve significantly. Once the target has been acquired,\
    \ the operator depresses the trigger, painting a proton 'patch' on the target.\
    \ Milliseconds later the rifle emits a high voltage arc of electricity, which\
    \ seeks out the charge differential and annihilates the target."
- name: "Enhanced Link Gun"
  description: "Riordan Dynamic Weapon Systems combines the best of weapon design\
    \ in the Advanced Plasma Rifle v23, commonly known as the Link Gun.|While the\
    \ primary firing mode of the Link remains the same as its plasma-firing predecessor,\

    \ energy from the onboard cells to boost the output of any targeted player also\

    \ they are unable to defend themselves from attack."
- name: "Enhanced Spider Mine Layer"
  description: "The Enhanced Spider Mine Layer is used for deploying spider mines,\
    \ autonomous mobile mines that are highly effective against both foot soldiers\
    \ and vehicles."
- name: "Enhanced Minigun"
  description: "The Schultz-Metzger T23-A 23mm rotary cannon is capable of firing\
    \ both high-velocity caseless ammunition and cased rounds. With an unloaded weight\
    \ of only 8 kilograms, the T23 is portable and maneuverable, easily worn across\
    \ the back when employing the optional carrying strap.|The T23-A is the rotary\
    \ cannon of choice for the discerning soldier."
- name: "Enhanced Grenade Launcher"
  description: "The Enhanced MGG Grenade Launcher fires magnetic sticky grenades,\
    \ which will attach to enemy players and vehicles."
- name: "Enhanced Target Painter"
  description: "The Enhanced Target Painter, similar to the Enhanced Ion Painter,\
    \ fires a harmless, low power laser with its primary fire. Unlike the Enhanced\
    \ Ion Painter, however, this weapon calls in a squadron of bombers that launches\
    \ a string of bombs in the direction the user is facing, centered on the painted\
    \ target. The bombs will easily incinerate the target and any unfortunates that\
    \ happen to be nearby."
- name: "Enhanced Ion Painter"
  description: "The Enhanced Ion Painter seems innocuous enough at first glance, emitting\
    \ a harmless low-power laser beam when the primary firing mode is engaged. Several\
    \ seconds later a multi-gigawatt orbital ion cannon fires on the target, neutralizing\
    \ any combatants in the vicinity.||The Ion Painter is a remote targeting device\
    \ used to orient and fire the VAPOR Ion Cannon. The Ion Painter offers increased\
    \ targeting accuracy via its telescopic sight, easily activated by the secondary\
    \ fire mode of the weapon.|Once the Ion Painter has been used to designate a target\
    \ it is highly recommended that the user put considerable distance between themselves\
    \ and the weapon's area of effect."
- name: "Enhanced Plasma Rifle"
  description: "Enhanced Plasma Rifle by Rumpleforeskin"
- name: "Enhanced Redeemer"
  description: "The first time you witness this miniature nuclear device in action,\
    \ you'll agree it is the most powerful weapon in the Tournament.|Launch a FAST-moving\
    \ and utterly devastating missile with the primary fire; but make sure you're\
    \ out of the RedeemerII's massive blast radius before it impacts. The secondary\
    \ fire allows you to guide the nuke yourself with a rocket's-eye view.||Keep in\
    \ mind, however, that you are vulnerable to attack when steering the RedeemerII's\
    \ projectile. Due to the extreme bulkiness of its ammo, the Redeemer is exhausted\
    \ after a single shot."
- name: "Enhanced Rocket Launcher"
  description: "The Trident Tri-barrel Rocket Launcher is extremely popular among\
    \ competitors who enjoy more bang for their buck.|The rotating rear loading barrel\
    \ design allows for both single- and multi-warhead launches, letting you place\
    \ up to three dumb fire rockets on target.|The warheads are designed to deliver\
    \ maximum concussive force to the target and surrounding area upon detonation."
- name: "Enhanced Shield Gun"
  description: "The Kemphler DD280 Riot Control Device has the ability to resist and\
    \ reflect incoming projectiles and energy beams. The plasma wave inflicts massive\
    \ damage, rupturing tissue, pulverizing organs, and flooding the bloodstream with\
    \ dangerous gas bubbles.||This weapon may be intended for combat at close range,\
    \ but when wielded properly should be considered as dangerous as any other armament\
    \ in your arsenal."
- name: "Enhanced Shock Rifle"
  description: "The ASMD Shock Rifle has changed little since its incorporation into\
    \ the Tournaments. The ASMD sports two firing modes capable of acting in concert\
    \ to neutralize opponents in a devastating shockwave.||This combination attack\
    \ is achieved when the weapon operator utilizes the secondary fire mode to deliver\
    \ a charge of seeded plasma to the target.|Once the slow-moving plasma charge\
    \ is within range of the target, the weapon operator may fire the photon beam\
    \ into the plasma core, releasing the explosive energy of the anti-photons contained\
    \ within the plasma's EM field."
- name: "Enhanced Sniper Rifle"
  description: "This high muzzle velocity sniper rifle with a 10X scope is a lethal\
    \ weapon at any range, especially if you can land a head shot."
- name: "Enhanced Translocator"
  description: "The Enhanced Translocator was originally designed by Liandri Corporation's\
    \ R&D sector to facilitate the rapid recall of miners during tunnel collapses.\
    \ However, rapid deresolution and reconstitution can have several unwelcome effects,\
    \ including increases in aggression and paranoia.||In order to prolong the careers\
    \ of today's contenders, limits have been placed on Translocator use in the lower-ranked\
    \ leagues. The latest iteration of the Translocator features a remotely operated\
    \ camera, exceptionally useful when scouting out areas of contention.|It should\
    \ be noted that while viewing the camera's surveillance output, the user is effectively\
    \ blind to their immediate surroundings."
