description: "BETA 1 - This mutator is intended to be used with the Game Speed mutator.\
  \ It will speed up or slow down your character movement to compensate for the slower\
  \ or faster passing of time, depending on Game Speed's settings. For this, simply\
  \ add the same value into the mutator's textfield as you did in Game Speed mutator\
  \ and it will neutralize the effect of too slow or too fast movement for you. Have\
  \ fun, Sly."
