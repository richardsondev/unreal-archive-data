  \ Hyperforce.   Some call it the Leviathan of the sky, some call it target practice:\
  \ The Helix ESV.   A powerfull flying MFV used by the taran militairy for fast transport\
  \ and supression fire has finaly made its way into the tournament there to prove\
  \ itsself to the contestance that its more than a big version of the Raptor.   It\
  \ uses the same anti gravity systems as the raptor so it needs a skillfull pilot\
  \ to controll it.              Specs: The helix is a multifunctional vehicle, capable\
  \ of Attack (at least 2 people needed), Defence (at least 2 people needed) support,\
  \ (1 person needed), and transport (for now only caracter transport because of a\
  \ karma in the main system of ut2004 prevents vehicles from being blocked by a moving\
  \ animation like the rear door). The vehicle has 2 player seats, the pilot can open\
  \ and close the rear door while the co-pilot can use a duel minigun turret to ventilate\
  \ everyone in its sights. the Duel Minigun brings 21 MM deplented uranium shells\
  \ to its target with so much power and speed the driver can just hold its crosshair\
  \ on the target and shoot it to pieces. The only downpart to the huge firepower\
  \ of this weapon is the mussleflash that makes it hard to aim. The Vehicle also\
  \ has an Item Depo that can re-arm and heal teammates.               A high amount\
  \ of stabelizers keeps the vehicle stable in flight, unfortionaly the ASMD weapons\
  \ are able to overload these stabelizers and make the vehicle hard to controll for\
  \ 1 or 2 seconds.                                                              \
