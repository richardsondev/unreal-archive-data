    \ damage, just heal, so he headed to the forums and asked if this existed. After\
    \ some time 100GPing100 (zeluis) saw the thread and said that he could create\
    \ the weapon for him. After the first realease FewPosts happeared on the forums\
    \ and sugested us to make the weapon heal team mates too, we accepted and that\
    \ is why this weapon now exists."
