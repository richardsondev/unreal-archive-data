  description: "The ASMD Shock Rifle has changed little since its incorporation into\
    \ the Tournaments. The ASMD sports two firing modes capable of acting in concert\
    \ to neutralize opponents in a devastating shockwave.||This combination attack\
    \ is achieved when the weapon operator utilizes the secondary fire mode to deliver\
    \ a charge of seeded plasma to the target.|Once the slow-moving plasma charge\
    \ is within range of the target, the weapon operator may fire the photon beam\
    \ into the plasma core, releasing the explosive energy of the anti-photons contained\
    \ within the plasma's EM field."
