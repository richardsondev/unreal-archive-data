  description: "Inexpensive and easily produced, the AR770 provides a lightweight\
    \ 5.56mm combat solution that is most effective against unarmored foes. With low-to-moderate\
    \ armor penetration capabilities, this rifle is best suited to a role as a light\
    \ support weapon.|The optional M355 Grenade Launcher provides the punch that makes\
    \ this weapon effective against heavily armored enemies.  Pick up a second assault\
    \ rifle to double your fire power."
- name: "Bio-Rifle"
  description: "The GES BioRifle continues to be one of the most controversial weapons\
    \ in the Tournament. Loved by some, loathed by others, the BioRifle has long been\
    \ the subject of debate over its usefulness.||Some Tournament purists argue that\
    \ it is the equivalent of a cowardly minefield. Others argue that it enhances\
    \ the tactical capabilities of defensive combatants.|Despite the debate, the weapon\
    \ provides rapid-fire wide-area coverage in primary firing mode, and a single-fire\
    \ variable payload secondary firing mode. In layman's terms, this equates to being\
    \ able to pepper an area with small globs of Biosludge, or launch one large glob\
    \ at the target."

  description: "The Kemphler DD280 Riot Control Device has the ability to resist and\
    \ reflect incoming projectiles and energy beams. The plasma wave inflicts massive\
    \ damage, rupturing tissue, pulverizing organs, and flooding the bloodstream with\
    \ dangerous gas bubbles.||This weapon may be intended for combat at close range,\
    \ but when wielded properly should be considered as dangerous as any other armament\
    \ in your arsenal."
