  description: "Trident Defensive Technologies Series 7 Flechette Cannon has been\
    \ taken to the next step in evolution with the production of the Mk3 Negotiator.\
    \ The ionized flechettes are capable of delivering second and third-degree burns\
    \ to organic tissue, cauterizing the wound instantly.||Payload delivery is achieved\
    \ via one of two methods: ionized flechettes launched in a spread pattern directly\
    \ from the barrel; or via fragmentation grenades that explode on impact, radiating\
    \ flechettes in all directions."
