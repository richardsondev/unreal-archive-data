  description: "Liandri's continued failure to deliver an updated replacement for\
    \ the beloved Ripper has led an independant weapons developer to take up the gauntlet.\
    \ The weapons and munitions division of R.A.D. Technologies has most certainly\
    \ delivered the goods. Featuring a sleek new look combined with deadly destructive\
    \ capabilites, the MkII Ripjack is a lethal weapon to be faced with. Get too cocky\
    \ and you could easily lose your head. Twitch your trigger finger at just the\
    \ wrong moment and you could just as easily shred yourself with an explosive razor.\
    \ Utmost caution is advised both while wielding the weapon and facing a competent\
    \ opponent wielding it."
