description: "There are TWO Mutators in this pack, one does set the default AmbientGlow\
  \ for the Players to 0, so, when you go to the shadows, the mesh model gets really\
  \ dark, and the other is the opposite, makes the default AmbientGlow 100%, so, even\
  \ on very dark shadows, players still 100% visible."
