- name: "UT3 Bio Rifle"
  description: "The GES BioRifle processes Tarydium from its stable crystalline form\
    \ into a reactive mutagenic sludge. It can rapidly disperse these toxins for wide-area\
    \ coverage, or fire a virulent payload of variable, but usually lethal, capacity.\
    \ In layman's terms, this means the BioRifle can pepper an area with small globs\
    \ of biosludge, or launch one noxious glob at the target. The BioRifle's ability\
    \ to carpet an area with a toxic minefield makes it a notoriously effective defensive\
    \ weapon."
- name: "UT3 Flak Cannon"
  description: "Trident Defensive Technologies continues to tweak and refine the flak\
    \ cannon with their newly released Mk4 "
- name: "UT3 Link Gun"
  description: "Riordan Dynamic Weapon Systems combines the best of weapon design\
    \ in the Advanced Plasma Rifle v23, commonly known as the Link Gun.|While the\
    \ primary firing mode of the Link remains the same as its plasma-firing predecessor,\
    \ the secondary cutting torch has been replaced with a switchable energy matrix.\
    \ Upon contacting a teammate, it converts to a harmless carrier stream, offloading\
    \ energy from the onboard cells to boost the output of any targeted player also\
    \ using the Link.|It should be noted that while players are boosting a teammate,\
    \ they are unable to defend themselves from attack."
- name: "UT3 Stinger Minigun"
  description: "Replacing the Minigun in this year's Tournament, the 'Stinger' is\
    \ actually a Liandri mining tool converted into military service.|The Stinger\
    \ fires shards of unprocessed Tarydium crystal at an alarming rate, raking opponents\
    \ with a storm of deadly needles. The alternate fire shoots larger hunks of crystal\
    \ that can knock back an opponent, sometimes even pinning them to walls."
- name: "UT3 Redeemer"
  description: "'Even your least effective soldiers will earn a respectable bodycount\
    \ with this tactical nuclear device.' So said the original brochure for the Redeemer,\
    \ still unchallenged in its role as the most powerful man-portable weapon system\
    \ known through the galaxy.|The slow-moving but utterly devastating missile, affectionately\
    \ known as 'Lola' by veteran soldiers, now uses an Enhanced Radiation payload.\
    \ This ensures maximum tissue failure without undue property damage, perfect for\
    \ modern assault-and-capture tactics.|The Redeemer's alternate mode fires the\
    \ missile using the disposable fly-by-wire guidance system, though the manual\
    \ recommends using this mode only in areas of relative safety."
- name: "UT3 Rocket Launcher"
  description: "Each year, more accidental deaths are caused by the Trident Tri-barrel\
    \ Rocket Launcher than in vehicular accidents and extreme sports combined. The\
    \ kill radius for its standard dumbfire rocket is surprisingly high by design\
    \ - so accidentally firing upon a nearby wall, or a nearby enemy soldier, can\
    \ be quite fatal for the operator. The alternate fire adds to this suicidal lethality\
    \ by loading and firing up to three rockets at once, in a spread, tight spiral,\
    \ or lobbed like grenades. Regardless of the grim statistics, veteran soldiers\
    \ still consider the 'old 8 ball' the most expedient way to put explosive ordnance\
    \ on target."
- name: "UT3 Shock Rifle"
  description: "The ASMD Shock Rifle has changed little since its first incorporation\
    \ into the Liandri Tournament. The ASMD sports two firing modes: a thin photon\
    \ beam, and a sphere of unstable plasma energy. These modes are each deadly in\
    \ their own right, but used together they can neutralize opponents in a devastating\
    \ shockwave. The energy spheres can be detonated with the photon beam, releasing\
    \ the explosive energy of the anti-photons in the plasma's EM containment field."
- name: "UT3 Sniper Rifle"
  description: "The venerable Axon Research long-range target interdiction rifle is\
    \ the weapon of choice for the discerning sniper. Acquisition of a target at distance\
    \ requires a steady hand, but the rewards merit the effort: the high-caliber round\
    \ is lethal at any range. With a precise headshot, the target will be neutralized\
    \ by the super-sonic bullet long before they hear the report. As they say in the\
    \ N.E.G. Marines: 'any shot you hear is nothing to be worried about.'"
