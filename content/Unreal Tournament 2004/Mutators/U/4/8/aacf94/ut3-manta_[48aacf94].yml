description: "Thanks to its ultra-lightweight armor and unmatched agility, the Axon\
  \ IFV Manta has repeatedly proven itself on battlefields across the galaxy. The\
  \ Manta is propelled by two flush-mounted, magnetically impelled fans which can\
  \ be instantly pitched, allowing the vehicle to leap high into the air, then quickly\
  \ duck below incoming obstacles or enemy fire. Its superior agility is paired with\
  \ two multi-stage plasma casters that burn hot and reload quickly, making the Manta\
  \ particularly effective in suppressing enemy infantry."
