weapons:
- name: "GES Bio-Rifle"
  description: "Classification: Toxic Rifle||Primary Fire: Wads of Tarydium byproduct\
    \ are lobbed at a medium rate of fire.||Secondary Fire: When trigger is held down,\
    \ the BioRifle will create a much larger wad of byproduct. When this wad is launched,\
    \ it will burst into smaller wads which will adhere to any surfaces.||Techniques:\
    \ Byproducts will adhere to walls, floors, or ceilings. Chain reactions can be\
    \ caused by covering entryways with this lethal green waste."
- name: "Enforcer"
  description: "Classification: Light PistolnnPrimary Fire: Accurate but slow firing\
    \ instant hit.nnSecondary Fire: Sideways, or 'Gangsta' firing mode, shoots faster\
    \ and less accurately than the primary fire.nnTechniques: Collect two for twice\
    \ the damage."
- name: "Flak Cannon"
  description: "Classification: Heavy Shrapnel||Primary Fire: White hot chunks of\
    \ scrap metal are sprayed forth, shotgun style.||Secondary Fire: A grenade full\
    \ of shrapnel is lobbed at the enemy.||Techniques: The Flak Cannon is far more\
    \ useful in close range combat situations."

  description: "Classification: Melee Piston||Primary Fire: When trigger is held down,\
    \ touch opponents with this piston to inflict massive damage.||Secondary Fire:\
    \ Damages opponents at close range and has the ability to deflect projectiles.||Techniques:\
    \ Shoot at the ground while jumping to jump extra high."
- name: "Minigun"
  description: "Classification: Gatling Gun||Primary Fire: Bullets are sprayed forth\
    \ at a medium to fast rate of fire and good accuracy.||Secondary Fire: Minigun\
    \ fires twice as fast and is half as accurate.||Techniques: Secondary fire is\
    \ much more useful at close range, but can eat up tons of ammunition."
- name: "Pulse Gun"
  description: "Classification: Plasma Rifle||Primary Fire: Medium sized, fast moving\
    \ plasma balls are fired at a fast rate of fire.||Secondary Fire: A bolt of green\
    \ lightning is expelled for 100 meters, which will shock all opponents.||Techniques:\
    \ Firing and keeping the secondary fire's lightning on an opponent will melt them\
    \ in seconds."
- name: "Redeemer"
  description: "Classification: Thermonuclear Device||Primary Fire: Launches a huge\
    \ yet slow moving missile that, upon striking a solid surface, will explode and\
    \ send out a gigantic shock wave, instantly pulverizing anyone or anything within\
    \ its colossal radius, including yourself.||Secondary Fire: Take control of the\
    \ missile and fly it anywhere.  You can press the primary fire button to explode\
    \ the missile early.||Techniques: Remember that while this rocket is being piloted\
    \ you are a sitting duck.  If an opponent manages to hit your incoming Redeemer\
    \ missile while it's in the air, the missile will explode harmlessly."

  description: "Classification: Ballistic Blade Launcher||Primary Fire: Razor sharp\
    \ titanium disks are launched at a medium rate of speed. Shots will ricochet off\
    \ of any surfaces.||Secondary Fire: Explosive disks are launched at a slow rate\
    \ of fire.||Techniques: Aim for the necks of your opponents."

  description: "Classification: Heavy Ballistic||Primary Fire: Slow moving but deadly\
    \ rockets are fired at opponents. Trigger can be held down to load up to six rockets\
    \ at a time, which can be fired at once.||Secondary Fire: Grenades are lobbed\
    \ from the barrel. Secondary trigger can be held as well to load up to six grenades.||Techniques:\
    \ Keeping this weapon pointed at an opponent will cause it to lock on, and while\
    \ the gun is locked the next rocket fired will be a homing rocket.  Because the\
    \ Rocket Launcher can load up multiple rockets, it fires when you release the\
    \ fire button."
- name: "ASMD Shock Rifle"
  description: "Classification: Energy Rifle||Primary Fire: Instant hit laser beam.||Secondary\
    \ Fire: Large, slow moving plasma balls.||Techniques: Hitting the secondary fire\

    \ explosion."

    \ bullet. Can kill instantly when applied to the cranium of opposing forces. ||Secondary\

    \ Fire: Large, slow moving plasma balls.||Techniques: Hitting the secondary fire\
    \ plasma balls with the regular fire's laser beam will cause an immensely powerful\
    \ explosion."
- name: "Translocator"
  description: "The Translocator was originally designed by Liandri Corporation's\
    \ R&D sector to facilitate the rapid recall of miners during tunnel collapses.\
    \ However, rapid deresolution and reconstitution can have several unwelcome effects,\
    \ including increases in aggression and paranoia.||In order to prolong the careers\
    \ of today's contenders, limits have been placed on Translocator use in the lower-ranked\
    \ leagues. The latest iteration of the Translocator features a remotely operated\
    \ camera, exceptionally useful when scouting out areas of contention.|It should\
    \ be noted that while viewing the camera's surveillance output, the user is effectively\
    \ blind to their immediate surroundings."
