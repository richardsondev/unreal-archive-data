weapons:
- name: "Lightning Gun"
  description: "The Lightning Gun is a high-power energy rifle capable of ablating\
    \ even the heaviest carapace armor. Acquisition of a target at long range requires\
    \ a steady hand, but the anti-jitter effect of the optical system reduces the\
    \ weapon's learning curve significantly. Once the target has been acquired, the\
    \ operator depresses the trigger, painting a proton 'patch' on the target. Milliseconds\
    \ later the rifle emits a high voltage arc of electricity, which seeks out the\
    \ charge differential and annihilates the target."
- name: "Shock Rifle"
  description: "The ASMD Shock Rifle has changed little since its incorporation into\
    \ the Tournaments. The ASMD sports two firing modes capable of acting in concert\
    \ to neutralize opponents in a devastating shockwave.||This combination attack\
    \ is achieved when the weapon operator utilizes the secondary fire mode to deliver\
    \ a charge of seeded plasma to the target.|Once the slow-moving plasma charge\
    \ is within range of the target, the weapon operator may fire the photon beam\
    \ into the plasma core, releasing the explosive energy of the anti-photons contained\
    \ within the plasma's EM field."
- name: "Rocket Launcher"
  description: "The Trident Tri-barrel Rocket Launcher is extremely popular among\
    \ competitors who enjoy more bang for their buck.|The rotating rear loading barrel\
    \ design allows for both single- and multi-warhead launches, letting you place\
    \ up to three dumb fire rockets on target.|The warheads are designed to deliver\
    \ maximum concussive force to the target and surrounding area upon detonation."
- name: "Minigun"
  description: "The Schultz-Metzger T23-A 23mm rotary cannon is capable of firing\
    \ both high-velocity caseless ammunition and cased rounds. With an unloaded weight\
    \ of only 8 kilograms, the T23 is portable and maneuverable, easily worn across\
    \ the back when employing the optional carrying strap.|The T23-A is the rotary\
    \ cannon of choice for the discerning soldier."
- name: "MatrixWeapon"
  description: "MatrixWeapon"
- name: "Link Gun"
  description: "Riordan Dynamic Weapon Systems combines the best of weapon design\
    \ in the Advanced Plasma Rifle v23, commonly known as the Link Gun.|While the\
    \ primary firing mode of the Link remains the same as its plasma-firing predecessor,\
    \ the secondary cutting torch has been replaced with a switchable energy matrix.\
    \ Upon contacting a teammate, it converts to a harmless carrier stream, offloading\
    \ energy from the onboard cells to boost the output of any targeted player also\
    \ using the Link.|It should be noted that while players are boosting a teammate,\
    \ they are unable to defend themselves from attack."
- name: "Flak Cannon"
  description: "Trident Defensive Technologies Series 7 Flechette Cannon has been\
    \ taken to the next step in evolution with the production of the Mk3 "
- name: "Sniper Rifle"
  description: "This high muzzle velocity sniper rifle with a 10X scope is a lethal\
    \ weapon at any range, especially if you can land a head shot."
- name: "Bio-Rifle"
  description: "The GES BioRifle continues to be one of the most controversial weapons\
    \ in the Tournament. Loved by some, loathed by others, the BioRifle has long been\
    \ the subject of debate over its usefulness.||Some Tournament purists argue that\
    \ it is the equivalent of a cowardly minefield. Others argue that it enhances\
    \ the tactical capabilities of defensive combatants.|Despite the debate, the weapon\
    \ provides rapid-fire wide-area coverage in primary firing mode, and a single-fire\
    \ variable payload secondary firing mode. In layman's terms, this equates to being\
    \ able to pepper an area with small globs of Biosludge, or launch one large glob\
    \ at the target."
- name: "Assault Rifle"
  description: "Inexpensive and easily produced, the AR770 provides a lightweight\
    \ 5.56mm combat solution that is most effective against unarmored foes. With low-to-moderate\
    \ armor penetration capabilities, this rifle is best suited to a role as a light\
    \ support weapon.|The optional M355 Grenade Launcher provides the punch that makes\
    \ this weapon effective against heavily armored enemies.  Pick up a second assault\
    \ rifle to double your fire power."
- name: "Sentinel Deployer"
  description: "Used to deploy, upgrade, retrieve, repair and sabotage Sentinels."
- name: "Repair Gun"
  description: "Repair Gun||TODO: Add a description."
- name: "Transdimensional Disturber"
  description: "The Transdimensional Disturber is one of the most powerful, and esoteric\
    \ weapons that Evil Corp. has ever produced. It uses state-of-the-art quantum\
    \ optics to produce enough negative energy to form a small wormhole. A wormhole\
    \ in itself can be enormously destructive, but there is an extra quirk that comes\
    \ from careful manipulation of the quantity and spectral content of the negative\
    \ energy, which allows this wormhole to be linked to a very specific point in\
    \ what is assumed to be a parallel universe. By an as yet undetermined mechanism,\
    \ certain forms of directed energy passed through the wormhole are vastly magnified\
    \ and reflected back very accurately at the closest humanoid. Such a beam is created\
    \ by the weapon's secondary fire."
- name: "FireChucker"
  description: "A perennial favourite with pyromaniacs everywhere, the FireChucker\
    \ is the ultimate close support weapon. Primary fire is a standard flamethrower,\
    \ capable of spewing burning death to a range of 40m. Secondary fire compresses\
    \ fuel to be hurled as a ball of fire of variable size which will explode on impact.\
    \ Because electronic systems are prone to EMP, it uses a low-tech pilot-light\
    \ for ignition and is almost entirely mechanical in operation. This makes it heavy,\
    \ but very robust and 100% reliable in the face of nuclear and electromagnetic\
    \ based weapons."
- name: "Fyrian Cannon"
  description: "The Fyrian Cannon represents the very pinnacle of kinetic weapons\
    \ technology, firing caseless 15mm ammunition at up to 900 rounds per minute.\
    \ It is surprisingly light and easy to handle despite its large size, thanks to\
    \ its unique hollow-walled construction and perfect balance. It features dual-speed\
    \ motorized barrels for optimum flexibility. At the standard speed setting it\
    \ fires at a conservative 540 rounds per minute, sustainable for prolonged periods\
    \ of time. At the high speed setting you get the full 900 rounds per minute, with\
    \ the additional bonus that the high temperatures generated at top speed increase\
    \ the damage potential of the bullets. To prevent damage to the weapon, it will\
    \ automatically shut down if the temperature exceeds the maximum safe operating\
    \ level. It will reactivate as soon as it has cooled sufficiently"
- name: "Helios"
  description: "Originally developed as an anti-aircraft weapon, the Helios uses a\
    \ revolutionary new form of micro-fusion reactor to produce large quantities of\
    \ both neutrons and gamma rays, which are collected in a reflection chamber to\
    \ be columnated and accelerated out of the barrel with a linear accelerator. This\
    \ beam of radiation is so energetic that it can compress and heat even the very\
    \ air to such a degree that spontaneous nuclear fusion occurs, leaving a trail\
    \ of what are literally miniature stars in its wake. It takes two seconds to fully\
    \ recharge after each shot, but the Helios may be re-fired before that at a reduced\
    \ power output if required."
- name: "Personal Ion Cannon"
  description: "There were those who said it was impossible - that an Ion Cannon could\
    \ never be made small enough for personal use, but once again it has been proved\
    \ that anything is possible. The combination of newly developed lightweight composite\
    \ materials and cutting-edge energy storage technology, brings instant destruction\
    \ of the highest magnitude to your fingertips. The PIC is in no way inferior to\
    \ its orbital counterpart, delivering the same 2TW of power to the same devastating\
    \ effect. It comes complete with variable zoom scope, self-adjusting shoulder\
    \ rest and a smart carry-case. Ion Cannon are very sensitive to movement whilst\
    \ firing. To prevent disruption, the PIC uses a gravitational stabilizer to hold\
    \ itself and the wielder perfectly still during the firing sequence."
- name: "Soar"
  description: "The Soar is a version of the military OAR-1 assault rifle, with a\
    \ reduced power output for Tournament use. It is designed as an alternative to\
    \ the standard Assault Rifle supplied to all Tournament competitors. Primary fire\
    \ is a low-power pulse-laser. Secondary fire launches plasma grenades that detonate\
    \ on impact. Note that the grenade launcher operates completely independently\
    \ of the primary fire, allowing both to be triggered simultaneously if required."
- name: "Steorra"
  description: "The Steorra is an enhanced version of the Helios featuring a larger,\
    \ more efficient reflection chamber and a higher power accelerator."
