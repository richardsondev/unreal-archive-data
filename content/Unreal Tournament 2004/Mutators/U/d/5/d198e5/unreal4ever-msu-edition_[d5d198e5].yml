- name: "Shrapnel Grenades"
  description: "These are the simplest and most straight forward of the grenades.\
    \ They explode and send out large chucks of metal that shred anything in their\
    \ way. Modern military grenades use fine shards of metal wire to get a more even\
    \ killing effect, but since the Tournaments is a spectator sport, the old Pineapple\
    \ grenade was brought back. It's large and easily visible metal shrapnel are more\
    \ dramatic. Also the large chunks are more effective against the, often well-armored,\
    \ Tournament contestants."

- name: "Python"
  description: "The .357 Python Magnum, or the Python for short, uses hollow tipped\
    \ rifle rounds with enough power to stop a small car with a single shot. Unlike\
    \ the Beretta, this weapon has no high-tech upgrades. It's a simple killing machine.\
    \ Alt-Fire reloads it's small 6-round chamber. Two shots can stop a charging Rhino,\
    \ or anybody else you don't care for."

  description: "Rift pad"
- name: "Beretta"
  description: "This simple weapon holds 15 rounds. It also has a targeting system\
    \ hidden within it called Cheap Shot, or CS for short. This increases the damage\
    \ the weapon does on a target merely by focusing the weapon on the victim over\
    \ time. The Beretta can kill with a single shot, if trained on a target long enough.\
    \ Alt-Fire reloads the weapon."
- name: "Bubble Gun"
  description: "Although the Bubblegun seems silly in action, you'd be wise not to\
    \ underestimate this weapon. Primary fire will inflate the heads of your victims\
    \ until they pop, instantly killing them. Alt-Fire allows you to trap your victims\
    \ for 5 seconds at a time. Only another Alt-Fire from a similar Bubblegun can\
    \ free somebody trapped inside the bubble. This is good for making quick escapes\
    \ when capturing a flag, or removing an enemy from the game without killing them,\
    \ so they can't respawn right away. No weapons fire can get into, or out of, the\
    \ Big Bubble trap. A prefect way to isolate any annoying pest."
- name: "Flying Grenades"
  description: "These grenades use duel propellers, just under the control device,\
    \ to lift into the air and slowly cruise towards any nearby targets. These are\
    \ primarily used to harass and distract the enemy. Their loud propellers are easy\
    \ to hear coming. A few of these can also gang up on a victim that's caught unaware.\
    \ They are good as area sentries, but they are also very easily destroyed by weapon's\
    \ fire."
- name: "Gas Grenades"
  description: "These are simple gas canister grenades. Inside the specially designed\
    \ glass housing of this grenade is an extremely caustic acid that effects both\
    \ organic and inorganic matter. Just a few seconds exposed can do great damage,\
    \ and the effect of this gas is cumulative, so more grenades can produce an even\
    \ more powerful effect. Great care should be exercised when using these grenades"
- name: "Hive Grenades"
  description: "The Hive grenade is actually an anti-gravity micro-missile launcher\
    \ platform with auto-gyro stabilization and mini-radar tracking system with auto\
    \ team detection and avoidance. Or basically, it fires 12 little missiles that\
    \ blast the crap out of anybody they find nearby. These missiles do very little\
    \ damage individually, but their ability to swarm like Killer Bees on any nearby\
    \ victim can make the combined effect very deadly."
- name: "Katana"
  description: "Inside this Medieval Japanese weapon is hidden a Bio-Enhancement unit\
    \ that accelerates the user's body functions. This gives the user super speed\
    \ and jumping ability. The unit is also capable of cloaking the user, but only\
    \ if the user does not engage in any violent actions, such as attacks. The cloak\
    \ automatically engages if the user stands still for 10 seconds. And if a cloak\
    \ and Bio-Enhancer wasn't impressive enough, the Katana also holds a short range\
    \ Teleporter Module. This is capable of teleporting the user out of harm's way,\
    \ or straight into a Tele-frag. The Teleporter Module though can only be used\
    \ once every 10 seconds, and then it needs to recharge. Also, Tournament rules\
    \ prohibit using the Katana wielder from carrying the flag, since the Bio-Enhancer's\
    \ speed would be a very unfair advantage. Of course, if somebody has your flag,\
    \ you are free to use the super speed to run them down and cut them up."
- name: "Quick Silver"
  description: "The Quicksilver shoots a stream of steel ribbon springs, at an adjustable\
    \ fire rate. Each razor sharp steel ribbon is capable of slicing into flesh and\
    \ thin metal like butter, but typically looses it's momentum inside the victim,\
    \ leaving them impaled by the Quicksilver's bolts. It's not usually for the Quicksilver\
    \ to turn somebody into a walking pin cushion. Alt-Fire cycles through the different\
    \ firing modes, from Single Fire, Auto Fire, and the terribly power Clip Burst.\
    \ The Clip Burst empties the entire clip in less the 1 second. With a full clip,\
    \ at close range, this is instant death."
- name: "Railgun"
  description: "The Railgun is a powerful sniping weapon that fires off high-speed\
    \ projectiles capable of penetrating any matter in it's path. Railgun rounds are\
    \ created out of an unstable pseudo matter that is harder then any other element\
    \ in existence, for about 1 second. As the pseudo matter decays into nothingness,\
    \ it moves at tremendous speed and cuts through anything in it's path, leaving\
    \ large path of destruction in it's wake. Alt-Fire uses the Radar Spectrum scope\
    \ on the top of the Rifle to track all living targets, even through walls. Although\
    \ these two together make the Railgun a potent Sniping weapon, the Railgun is\
    \ nearly microscopic projectiles can make it hard to hit with. Also the slow firing\
    \ rate leave you vulnerable to attack. And if you aren't moving, you are easy\
    \ prey for anyone else with a similar Railgun."
- name: "Reaper"
  description: "The Reaper is a deceptively advanced weapon. When thrown in the air,\
    \ it uses anti-gravity jets to propel it great distances to any target. The internal\
    \ guidance keeps it flying straight, even after it bounces off walls or slices\
    \ through flesh. It also tracks the radar signature of the user, allowing it to\
    \ be summoned back with Alt-Fire. Using Alt-Fire carefully and good aim, it's\
    \ possible to snipe with the Reaper. And because you can call it back in mid flight,\
    \ you can throw it through a victim's body and summon it back after it goes through\
    \ them, allow you to inflict even more damage on the return stroke! Less experienced\
    \ users though should be careful. The Reaper can not return unless there is a\
    \ clear path between it and the user."
- name: "Sticky Grenades"
  description: "These deceptively benign looking grenades hide their insidious nature.\
    \ The sticky grenades cling to the first enemy they come into contract with, but\
    \ they don't explode right away. They simple cling to the body and wait for someone\
    \ else to come into range, then they trigger a powerful explosion. This can often\
    \ kill nearby enemies, as well as the victim in question. By loading up a victim\
    \ with a few of these grenades, you can turn them into a walking bomb for your\
    \ own amusement. Just make sure you aren't nearby when the grenades are activated."
- name: "Tomahawk"
  description: "The Tomahawk is a remotely guided missile launcher. Each Tomahawk\
    \ missile contains a small video camera that is automatically linked to the player's\
    \ HUD when fired. In primary fire, this pops up a small window for simple guidance.\
    \ But if you need more control, Alt-Fire will put you into full screen mode."
