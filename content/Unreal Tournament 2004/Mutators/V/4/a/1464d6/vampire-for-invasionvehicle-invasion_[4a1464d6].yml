  \ to respawn right after death to keep playing, only suffering the -10 points penalty.\
  \ It also optionally disables vehicle run over damage for monsters which used to\
  \ make Vehicle Invasion trivially easy. Squash damage can still be applied when\
  \ a monster is squished against a wall."
