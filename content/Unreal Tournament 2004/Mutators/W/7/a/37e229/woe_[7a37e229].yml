- name: "Weapons of Evil: Sentinel"
  description: "Gives the Sentinel Deployer as a default weapon and replaces various\

weapons:
- name: "Sentinel Deployer"
  description: "Used to deploy, upgrade, retrieve, repair and sabotage Sentinels."
- name: "Repair Gun"
  description: "Repair Gun||TODO: Add a description."
- name: "CFX"
  description: "The CFX primary-fire launches dart-like projectiles that will attach\
    \ themselves to any fleshy target (luckily they also work on robots and Juggernaut\
    \ armour) but will bounce off of walls and floors. These projectiles are the first\
    \ practical application of a new technology know as the 'Electromagnetic Field\
    \ Attenuator' which is capable of disrupting the chemical bonds between atoms,\
    \ causing the matter to literally fall apart. Because of the unstable nature of\
    \ this technology, each projectile can have only a limited effect when detonated\
    \ using the weapons alt-fire, but multiple projectiles (up to ten at once) attached\
    \ to the same target will interact with each other, doing exponentially more damage.\
    \ If enough damage is caused to totally disrupt the whole target, the release\
    \ of energy will be so great as to cause a sizable explosion."
- name: "Crispe"
  description: "The Crispe is the result of the combination of Heisenberg's Uncertainty\
    \ Principle and traditional laser technology. Whereas lasers are severely limited\
    \ for atmospheric use by the fact that air absorbs most of the photons before\
    \ the target is reached, the Crispe employs the latest in electromagnetic field\
    \ technology to create a phase-coherent beam of electrons, which are accelerated\
    \ to 99.51% of the speed of light and thus take on wave-like properties (hence\
    \ 'Crispe', from Cathode Ray Induction by Stimulated Particle Emission). We understand\
    \ the importance of a tactically flexible weapon, so a torch (flashlight for all\
    \ you North Americans) has been incorporated as the weapon's secondary fire, after\
    \ all, you can only hit what you can see! For ease of use, the Crispe can be powered\
    \ from any standard CC2 size battery, although we recommend that you use genuine\
    \ CrispeCell batteries for maximum battery life."
- name: "Transdimensional Disturber"
  description: "The Transdimensional Disturber is one of the most powerful, and esoteric\
    \ weapons that Evil Corp. has ever produced. It uses state-of-the-art quantum\
    \ optics to produce enough negative energy to form a small wormhole. A wormhole\
    \ in itself can be enormously destructive, but there is an extra quirk that comes\
    \ from careful manipulation of the quantity and spectral content of the negative\
    \ energy, which allows this wormhole to be linked to a very specific point in\
    \ what is assumed to be a parallel universe. By an as yet undetermined mechanism,\
    \ certain forms of directed energy passed through the wormhole are vastly magnified\
    \ and reflected back very accurately at the closest humanoid. Such a beam is created\
    \ by the weapon's secondary fire."
- name: "FireChucker"
  description: "A perennial favourite with pyromaniacs everywhere, the FireChucker\
    \ is the ultimate close support weapon. Primary fire is a standard flamethrower,\
    \ capable of spewing burning death to a range of 40m. Secondary fire compresses\
    \ fuel to be hurled as a ball of fire of variable size which will explode on impact.\
    \ Because electronic systems are prone to EMP, it uses a low-tech pilot-light\
    \ for ignition and is almost entirely mechanical in operation. This makes it heavy,\
    \ but very robust and 100% reliable in the face of nuclear and electromagnetic\
    \ based weapons."
- name: "Fyrian Cannon"
  description: "The Fyrian Cannon represents the very pinnacle of kinetic weapons\
    \ technology, firing caseless 15mm ammunition at up to 900 rounds per minute.\
    \ It is surprisingly light and easy to handle despite its large size, thanks to\
    \ its unique hollow-walled construction and perfect balance. It features dual-speed\
    \ motorized barrels for optimum flexibility. At the standard speed setting it\
    \ fires at a conservative 540 rounds per minute, sustainable for prolonged periods\
    \ of time. At the high speed setting you get the full 900 rounds per minute, with\
    \ the additional bonus that the high temperatures generated at top speed increase\
    \ the damage potential of the bullets. To prevent damage to the weapon, it will\
    \ automatically shut down if the temperature exceeds the maximum safe operating\
    \ level. It will reactivate as soon as it has cooled sufficiently"
- name: "Helios"
  description: "Originally developed as an anti-aircraft weapon, the Helios uses a\
    \ revolutionary new form of micro-fusion reactor to produce large quantities of\
    \ both neutrons and gamma rays, which are collected in a reflection chamber to\
    \ be columnated and accelerated out of the barrel with a linear accelerator. This\
    \ beam of radiation is so energetic that it can compress and heat even the very\
    \ air to such a degree that spontaneous nuclear fusion occurs, leaving a trail\
    \ of what are literally miniature stars in its wake. It takes two seconds to fully\
    \ recharge after each shot, but the Helios may be re-fired before that at a reduced\
    \ power output if required."
- name: "Personal Ion Cannon"
  description: "There were those who said it was impossible - that an Ion Cannon could\
    \ never be made small enough for personal use, but once again it has been proved\
    \ that anything is possible. The combination of newly developed lightweight composite\
    \ materials and cutting-edge energy storage technology, brings instant destruction\
    \ of the highest magnitude to your fingertips. The PIC is in no way inferior to\
    \ its orbital counterpart, delivering the same 2TW of power to the same devastating\
    \ effect. It comes complete with variable zoom scope, self-adjusting shoulder\
    \ rest and a smart carry-case. Ion Cannon are very sensitive to movement whilst\
    \ firing. To prevent disruption, the PIC uses a gravitational stabilizer to hold\
    \ itself and the wielder perfectly still during the firing sequence."
- name: "Parasite"
  description: "The mechanism behind this weapon's operation was discovered quite\
    \ by accident. At its heart resides a crystal of indeterminate composition, which\
    \ alters a low-intensity light shone through it in a manner which has stumped\
    \ our scientists. The resulting beam of altered light is capable of literally\
    \ sucking the life out of living organisms (strangely it also affects robots,\
    \ but not plants) and returning it back up the beam, where travels back through\
    \ the crystal and is infused into the wielder, actually healing wounds and making\
    \ hair shiny and healthy-looking.||Furthermore, if the applied beam of light is\
    \ of a particular wavelength, the effect changes slightly so that it leeches certain\
    \ chemicals instead. This is particularly useful in the Tournament as it works\
    \ with the special adrenaline used by competitors."
- name: "PepperPot"
  description: "PepperPot rockets are like bees: A single bee (or rocket in this case)\
    \ is but a minor distraction, but a whole swarm of them can take down an enemy\
    \ many thousands of times their size. Nine rockets can be launched simultaneously,\
    \ which left to themselves will simply carry on in a straight line, as rockets\
    \ like to do. However the PepperPot also comes with a dart gun which fires a dart\
    \ fitted with a homing beacon. The rockets will automatically pick up the signal\
    \ and home in on it with remarkable agility."
- name: "Soar"
  description: "The Soar is a version of the military OAR-1 assault rifle, with a\
    \ reduced power output for Tournament use. It is designed as an alternative to\
    \ the standard Assault Rifle supplied to all Tournament competitors. Primary fire\
    \ is a low-power pulse-laser. Secondary fire launches plasma grenades that detonate\
    \ on impact. Note that the grenade launcher operates completely independently\
    \ of the primary fire, allowing both to be triggered simultaneously if required."
- name: "Steorra"
  description: "The Steorra is an enhanced version of the Helios featuring a larger,\
    \ more efficient reflection chamber and a higher power accelerator."
