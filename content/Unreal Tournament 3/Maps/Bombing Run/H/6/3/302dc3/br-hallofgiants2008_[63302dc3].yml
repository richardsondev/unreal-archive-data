description: "From original Map: The Hall Of Giants is now open to the Tournament\
  \ again after being closed for some time for renovation. Only a few relatively minor\
  \ modifications have been made to the structure, which has been widely acclaimed\
  \ due to its uniqueness over other CTF maps. Features of the Hall include its extreme\
  \ height, its complete low-gravity environment, its intense lighting (has gone !!!\
  \ (HO)), its peculiar speed tubes (don't work with Bots (HO)), and its huge variety\
  \ of tactical approaches to victory. Its one thing getting the enemy flag, its another\
  \ thing getting it to yours..."
