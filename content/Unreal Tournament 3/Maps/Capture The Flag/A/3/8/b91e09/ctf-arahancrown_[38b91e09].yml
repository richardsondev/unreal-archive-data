description: "Most draw a bold, absolute line between the 'Real' and the 'dream'.\
  \ Some have beliefs that the 'Dream' is a mental manifestation of the 'Real'. Others\
  \ believe quite the opposite. Some are enlightened to a point that Life is a state\
  \ of being that combines 'Dream', 'Real' and nothingness: a complete removal from\
  \ reality as we know it. Very few know what a heavy crown Arahan can be."
