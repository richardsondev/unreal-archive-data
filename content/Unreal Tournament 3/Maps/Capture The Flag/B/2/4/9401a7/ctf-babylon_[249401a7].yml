description: "\"An ancient wonder from the old time, The Hanging Gardens of Babylon,\
  \ inspired many to achieve a perfect meld of nature and stone....  Amid the time\
  \ of first contact with the Human race the Liandri presented a gift to the Humans.\
  \ A Garden suspended in high altitude within the atmosphere of a gas giant in a\
  \ star sector bordering the regions of both races. Recreating the legend of the\
  \ Hanging Garden in the most inhospitable of places where one can enjoy the marvel\
  \ of a human habitat mixed with the high technology of the Liandri. The Liandri\
  \ constructed machines to draw moisture from the atmosphere to keep the gardens\
  \ alive for many generations. Over the decades after the great war the garden location\
  \ was lost. Now rediscovered a feud between the races has erupted over control of\
  \ this marvel. Blood and bone now polute the water from the constant fighting.\""
