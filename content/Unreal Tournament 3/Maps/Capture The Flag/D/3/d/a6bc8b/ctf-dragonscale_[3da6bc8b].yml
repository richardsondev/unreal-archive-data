description: "DragonScale one, simple training ground of Izanagi on Earth. This simple\
  \ battle place is most favorite for Izanagi commanders. It's last training, before\
  \ giving trooper the knowledge of vehicle control. Here soldiers have to learn how\
  \ to avoid fire from master of turret, and team must cooperate too, other way it\
  \ lose. Of course turret mech, can be hijacked or destroyed by Redeemer, which fighter\
  \ need to find. This training is really hard and difficult, and that's the reason\
  \ why Izanagi Corporation has so great tactics and commanders on the battlefield...\
  \ In this place recruits, learn truly and hardly, how to win not only by pushing\
  \ the trigger of gun."
