description: "During a sea trip, a Lord discovered this island. It wasn't on any maritime\
  \ map? Since his initial exploration, he fell under it's charm for it's sublime\
  \ atmosphere. He then decided to construct a temple in honor of his beautiful wife\
  \ Fatima. Unfortunately for the Lord, when Fatima visited the temple, which was\
  \ still under construction, the soil perpetual tremors made Fatima sick enough to\
  \ make her leave the island. The Lord decided to leave the temple in an unfinished\
  \ state. This place is now used as a training camp for his soldiers. Good training\
  \ soldier!"
