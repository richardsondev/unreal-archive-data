description: "Built near one of the poles of a classified celestial body with the\
  \ intent of studying various different aspects of gravitational energy, the Gravis\
  \ research campus sat empty for years following political fallout over the bloated\
  \ budget scope of the project. The facility would be used only 7 months every 2\
  \ years, due to extreme temperature shifts during a large part of the planetoid's\
  \ orbital cycle. Both to appease the opposition in the New Earth Government and\
  \ as a means to offset project costs, small adjustments were made so the facility's\
  \ main hub could be locked off for highly lucrative tournament play."
