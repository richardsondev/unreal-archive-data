description: "Once occupied by Axon, this base under rock was used to store mainly\
  \ toxic containers. It was discovered by coincidence by the Necris. The Necris have\
  \ setup this base & use it as a 'Nano' storehouse. We can found several types of\
  \ Nano, the yellow, the yellow/orange, the green & the black."
