description: "Welcome to planet Stratus a once uninhabitable hot rock. This facility\
  \ and many other have been reducing the hostile atmosphere of the planet, generating\
  \ seas and breathable air. However not all stations are functional causing a dramatic\
  \ increase in the planets temperatures. This processing station is now used in the\
  \ tournament as it has not been fully operating for years, with flooding on the\
  \ lower levels of this stratus facility, once you reach the top, there is only one\
  \ way down. V1.2"
