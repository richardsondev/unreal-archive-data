description: "A strange tree, believed to bear life giving fruit, has been discovered\
  \ growing from the bottom of a mysterious crater.  Two organisations have carved\
  \ bases into the crater's walls in the hope of harnessing the tree's powers, but\
  \ neither wants to share their fruit with the other; so at dawn one cold, winter\
  \ morning they each set about trying to sabotage the other's operations."
