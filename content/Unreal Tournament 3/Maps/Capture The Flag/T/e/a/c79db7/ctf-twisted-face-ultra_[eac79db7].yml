description: "The remains of \"Face\" have opened a new portal in a world of rotating\
  \ demolition. A dark edifice has risen to power, reinforced with Necri implications\
  \ and the outer worldly technology of the Landri. In the midst of hurling asteroids\
  \ and the gravitational pull of a nearby planet, time has no meaning. Welcome to\
  \ a transformed way of warfare on Twisted Face!"
