description: "This is the third Unreal game I've made this 'spam-in-a-box' map for.\
  \ Can't wait for UT4(or whatever they call it) to come out so I can punish the community\
  \ with it again.:P Actually, the only reason I remade it was to acquaint myself\
  \ with the new editor. Thx to |-Vp-|Wolverine for pushing me to map again, |-Vp-|Slider\
  \ for the billboard textures and F.E.A.R. for making it so easy to steal, I mean\
  \ borrow the graffiti textures. Happy Fragging!!(yeah, right...as if anyone actually\
  \ reads these files)"
