description: "This abandoned mine was once used by the Nali to extract Tarydium, a\
  \ powerful mineral that strengthened the Nali's magical power. According to the\
  \ Nali legends, the place has been abandoned after a collapsed wall revealed the\
  \ nest of a giant mythical creature.   Liandri recently reopened the mining complex\
  \ in search for a new Tournament arena. You have been chosen to test this new promising\
  \ Duel arena right in the middle of the complex, good luck.        DM-Aelon version\
  \ 1.00. Made by XYZ 8000."
