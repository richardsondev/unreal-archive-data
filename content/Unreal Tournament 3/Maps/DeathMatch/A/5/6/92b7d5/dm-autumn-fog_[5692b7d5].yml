description: "Long time ago some mystic crystalformations where found in the woods\
  \ near Barken. Soon little towns emerged from the ground and the diggin for the\
  \ new material began. As it was discovered that the crystals where absolutely use\
  \ and worthless the mining industry broke down and many pits are now waiting for\
  \ the nature to be taken back."
