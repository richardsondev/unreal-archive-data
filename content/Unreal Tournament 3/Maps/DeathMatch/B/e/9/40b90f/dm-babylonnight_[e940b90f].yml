description: "An ancient wonder from the old time, The Hanging Gardens of Babylon,\
  \ inspired many to achieve a perfect meld of nature and stone.... Amid the time\
  \ of first contact with the Human race the Liandri presented a gift to the Humans.\
  \ A Garden suspended in space in a star sector bordering the regions of both races.\
  \ Recreating the legend of the Hanging Garden in the most inhospitable of places\
  \ where one can enjoy the marvel of a human habitat mixed with the high technology\
  \ of the Liandri. The Liandri constructed machines to protect the garden and draw\
  \ moisture from the surrounding star dust to keep the gardens alive for many generations.\
  \ Over the decades after the great war the garden location was lost. Now rediscovered\
  \ a feud between the races has erupted over control of this marvel. Blood and bone\
  \ now polute the water from the constant fighting."
