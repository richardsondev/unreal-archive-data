description: "The Niberian forest hides innumerable natural resources. Endura, a deep\
  \ cave where several rivers meet to create a fascinating show, is one place where\
  \ these assets are found. Long ago an attempt was made to exploit the raw Tribium\
  \ found here, but the force of the mining made the cave too unstable to continue.\
  \  The only remains are hundreds of rickety wooden platforms, the only things that\
  \ desperately hold this place together."
