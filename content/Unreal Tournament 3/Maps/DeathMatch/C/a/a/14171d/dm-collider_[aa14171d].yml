description: "The Liandri SuperCollider has been responsible for breakthroughs in\
  \ Slow Field technology as byproducts from the experiments were discovered to effect\
  \ matter & mass. Prolonged exposure to these particle byproducts though have shown\
  \ to effect ones molecular structure and is being researched for possible uses in\
  \ Invisibilty technology as well. However, direct exposure to the SuperCollider\
  \ beam is almost always fatal & should be avoided at all costs. Dr. Helen Boson,\
  \ Head of particle research at Liandri Corporation, holds a private unsanctioned\
  \ tournament at the SuperCollider lab. She taunts contestants barking orders from\
  \ her control room, ready to flip the SuperCollider switch at any given moment."
