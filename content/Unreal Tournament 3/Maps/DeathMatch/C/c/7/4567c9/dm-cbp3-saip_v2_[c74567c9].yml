description: "Y'know when those Liandri guys came up to me they was like 'We would\
  \ like to acquire your boat for use in the Tournament as a floater-type arena'.\
  \ And I was like 'Yeah, my baby be floatin', aight.' But then they was like 'Of\
  \ course we will adequately compensate you for the inconvenience.' And sh*t I know\
  \ what that means! So I'm like 'Please do come in gentlemen, may I offer you some\
  \ refreshments?'"
