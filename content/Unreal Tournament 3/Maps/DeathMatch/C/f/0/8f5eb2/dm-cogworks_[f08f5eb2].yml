description: "Once Cog Works was a busy energy plant. But several wrok accidents caused\
  \ the workers to riot. The angry workeres, in their rage destroyed most of the facility\
  \ and it was forced to shut its doors. Today Cog Works, what hasn't been completely\
  \ destroyed during the riots, has been bought out and repaired to be used in bloody\
  \ duels."
