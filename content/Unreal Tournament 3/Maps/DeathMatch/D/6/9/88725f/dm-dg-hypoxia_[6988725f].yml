description: "High atop the Liandri Robotics Corporation building, the experimental\
  \ Berzerk Gas was accidentally released into the air conditioning ducts of the top\
  \ floor.  This caused an immediate floor lock-down, the lower floors of the building\
  \ were evacuated, and the maintenance workers trapped on the floor went crazy. \
  \ Will you survive the mayhem?"
