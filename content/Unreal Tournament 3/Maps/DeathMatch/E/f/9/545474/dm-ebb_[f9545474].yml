description: "Is nature peaceful? It may seem that way in comparison to larger organisms,\
  \ but on the microscopic level it is in a constant tug-of-war. The ecosystem of\
  \ Ebb isn't thwarted by the hostility of outsiders -- it feeds off of it -- transforming\
  \ the most horrific acts of violence into its weaving vines, trickling waterfalls,\
  \ and lush vegetation. Beauty isn't skin deep anymore."
