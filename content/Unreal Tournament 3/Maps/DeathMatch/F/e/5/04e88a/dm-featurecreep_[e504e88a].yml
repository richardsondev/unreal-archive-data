description: "It was a starry night until the clouds came. First there was a calm\
  \ darkness, followed by the gentle drips of cascading rain -- the sound of an endless\
  \ ovation. Ignorant residents disregard any stirring outside as the yells of an\
  \ angry sky and continue living their sane lives -- slaves to the newscaster on\
  \ TV. Those outside know the truth, though, and are welcomed by it. What's left\
  \ standing in this city is supported by the debris of that which has fallen; a frightening\
  \ reminder that even steel cripples under water. Despite the dissonance from rolling\
  \ hills and flowery fields, there seems to be an undeniable charm about it all.\
  \ At least the lights are still on..."
