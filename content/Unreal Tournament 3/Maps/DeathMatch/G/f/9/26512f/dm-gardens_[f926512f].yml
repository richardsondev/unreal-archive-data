description: "Following the success of the tournament, confrontations became a professional\
  \ sport in all respects. This made necessary the construction of new arenas for\
  \ training. The Liandri Corporation decided to build a few satellites, similar to\
  \ the moon, where to create new arenas, with no constraints of space or law. On\
  \ this one are reproduced the colonial gardens of the ronin clan."
