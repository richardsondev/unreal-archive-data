description: "Thanks to some seats Liandri acquired on the local antiquities board,\
  \ they were able to gain rights to a historic building in downtown Akron. Its rooftop\
  \ garden along with some adjacent buildings made a perfect opportunity for some\
  \ cross-rooftop jump-pad madness. But if you don't like the idea of flying across\
  \ urban canyons, don't worry. The rooftops have plenty of less precarious areas\
  \ as well."
