description: "In the midst of the arctic mountain peaks lies the Icy Apex. The weather/communications\
  \ tower mysteriously became abandoned many years ago. There remains an eerie energy\
  \ in the air that you feel as you pass through the frigid halls. You will find that\
  \ there is no escaping the frightful feeling as you exit the building seeking refuse\
  \ on the rusted walkways. Here you will find low visibility from the looming fog.\
  \ Watch your step, as there are broken railings all around. For if you lose your\
  \ footing it is a lethal distance into the wintry depths below."
