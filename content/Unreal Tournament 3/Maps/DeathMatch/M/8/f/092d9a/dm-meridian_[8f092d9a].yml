description: "In the sky, a meridian is an imaginary great circle on the celestial\
  \ sphere. It passes through the north point on the horizon, through the celestial\
  \ pole, up to the zenith, through the south point on the horizon, and through the\
  \ nadir, and is perpendicular to the local horizon.  You are here."
