description: "The Liandri experiment has failed! Aboard a deep space research station\
  \ in a remote star system bordering the outer region of their empire they constructed\
  \ a highly advanced power core powered by a singularity.  Originally more than a\
  \ complete success, the radiating energy from the core mutated bacteria trapped\
  \ within the rocky structure of the station into simple plant life spreading throughout\
  \ the station interior.  Realizing the potential the Liandri built a large scale\
  \ version on a nearby planet hoping to begin terraforming experiments on a mass\
  \ scale.  The experiment ended in catastrophic failure...The singularity breached\
  \ containment.  Feeding off the planets matter it evolved into a black hole eating\
  \ all matter within its grasp.  With the prototype generator still operating within\
  \ the research station, rival races have sent their best agents to secure the generator\
  \ schematics buried deep within the computer systems before they are lost forever\
  \ to the black holes gravity well...."
