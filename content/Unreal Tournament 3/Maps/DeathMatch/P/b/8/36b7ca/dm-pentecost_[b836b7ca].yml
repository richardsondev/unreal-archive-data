description: "Evil radiates from this place.  Even the plants seem to have trouble\
  \ surviving its malignant radiance. Wicked mages and warriors used to summon the\
  \ wealthy with spells to this evil castle.  They would then pick them clean of anything\
  \ of value before sending them crashing to their death, through one of the many\
  \ deathpits in the complex.   Now the forces of darkness have resurrected this facility\
  \ for the final battle and are using it to train their forces.  Fear not sinner,\
  \ your day of judgement is nigh......"
