description: "Rising towers of steel and glass, landscapes of reflection, glistening\
  \ in the sunshine........landscapes called skylines and cities.  Roads and highways\
  \ tearing across the land, laid out across the world like straps securing the last\
  \ fighting efforts of a madman restrained.  Computers of silicone and copper and\
  \ metals unknown to all but a select few. These trappings of the modern and future\
  \ age are a mystery here, not yet part of this serene, unspoiled bit of the world,\
  \ a bit of the world where an arcane power has been set on high. On high among a\
  \ myriad of giants who have reigned here for thousands of years.  These giants have\
  \ been here for an age undisturbed and will remain so for ages yet to come. Giants,\
  \ called redwoods by others, in other cultures.  The power which resides here among\
  \ these majestic trees is of such a force, that gravity itself is almost held at\
  \ bay by its malignant power.  The people once native to this land have only recently\
  \ been shunted aside and pushed out of their once prestine temple among the trees.\
  \  Now this once peacefull place has become a place of violence, of blood and screams\
  \ and war. Even here in this once peacefull part of the world, these quiet, these\
  \ beautiful, these Tokara Falls."
