description: "As time has passed, the Valley of the Hunters has found a new home on\
  \ the planet of Kaimogen.  Some have said that the spirits of those who were killed\
  \ in the Necris War have found a resting place among these lands.  These spirits\
  \ have been known to give warnings to those who are in danger.  As the cold winds\
  \ blow and night covers the arena, hope that you find their favor, which just might\
  \ save your life."
