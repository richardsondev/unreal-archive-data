description: "A small cargo ship left the port of New York 2 weeks ago heading north.\
  \ No one has had any contact with the crew, who are assumed dead. Not 3 days after\
  \ declared missing, a drifting boat spotted the cargo ship idle in an arctic region.\
  \ The ship did not move. Scuba divers later found out that the propellers were tangled\
  \ in some sort of wire. The crew were never found."
