description: "After breaking down on a desolate road in the middle of nowhere, you\
  \ spend the night in a rundown backwater motel while your ride is being repaired\
  \ across the way at Deke's Salvage. You awaken to disturbing sounds and head outside\
  \ to investigate. You find that the locals have vanished along with your ride. The\
  \ road ahead is washed out and the road back is blocked. Keep your flashlight handy,\
  \ for you have no choice but to make you stand in this backwater bayou as the hoards\
  \ of evil emerge..."
