description: "A majestic city in the sky, long ago abandoned by an alien race. Sprawling\
  \ chases through the streets and over the rooftops ensue! A tribute to Metroid Prime\
  \ 3. Music from Skytown Elysia. I would like to thank Epic for the tools, everyone\
  \ who beta tested the map, anyone who puts it on a server and everyone who downloads\
  \ it. Thank you very much!"
