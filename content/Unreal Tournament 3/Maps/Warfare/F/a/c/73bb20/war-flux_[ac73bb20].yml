description: "Project Flux was designed by the Liandri Corporation specificly to make\
  \ warfare more deathmatch oriented. The dynamic battlefield is seperated from regular\
  \ warfare maps by its smaller scale, and is intentionally constructed to appeal\
  \ to hardcore oldsk00l DM/CTF players whilst still keeping classic warfare players\
  \ feeling at home."
