description: "Fragments remaining from the shattered world left behind by the turmoil\
  \ and tempestuous civil war on Endotermik III, these autonomous mining colonies\
  \ were left to the biting winds and violent weathering to become one with the planet\
  \ again; however, mechanized beings with a purpose never stop, and so these colonies\
  \ continued to sustain themselves, pumping out 200 kilotons of ore, each revolution\
  \ around the star system, a solar year."
