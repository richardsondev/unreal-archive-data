description: "Tanglewood is an ancient forest wetland with large, twisted trees, the\
  \ canopy almost blocking out the sky. Once inhabited by a great civilisation, all\
  \ that remains is scattered ruins and architecture built around the trees themselves.\
  \ The two teams fight for control over the wetland and the Lightning Temple at the\
  \ its heart."
