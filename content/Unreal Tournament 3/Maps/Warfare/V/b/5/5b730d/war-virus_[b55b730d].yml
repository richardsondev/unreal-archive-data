description: "In their assault of Orich IV, the Necris's first move was to take over\
  \ the main orbital station.  This was done by sending a virus to the station's two\
  \ main processing cores, but unfortunately only one was infected.  However, if the\
  \ one of the cores were destroyed then control of the station would default entirely\
  \ to the other, so both Necris and the station defence forces dispatched teams to\
  \ the mainframe tower to decide control of the station."
