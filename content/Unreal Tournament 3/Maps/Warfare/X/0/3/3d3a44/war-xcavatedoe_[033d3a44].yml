description: "While excavating for the construction of a new robotics research facility,\
  \ the Landri Robotics Corporation uncovered what appears to be a portion of a historic\
  \ 20th century city.  The cost of demolition for this almost untouched relic of\
  \ ancient society proved to be to excessive, so the LRC decided to turn this primitive\
  \ site over to the Tournament as a battlefield on the home planet."
