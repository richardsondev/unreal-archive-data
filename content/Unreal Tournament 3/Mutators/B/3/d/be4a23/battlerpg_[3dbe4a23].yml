description: "With BattleRPG each player gets a persistent level and persistent experience.\
  \ This  means the server keeps a database and remembers your achievements permanently.\
  \ For each point you score you get experience, if you have enough experience you\
  \ go to the next level: * The first 10 levels are very easy to get players to learn\
  \ how RPG works * Reaching level 80 requires some serious playing but is doable\
  \ * Level 100 is tougher to reach * Over level 100 it becomes extremely hard  Besides\
  \ experience and levels you also collect Mana. Mana is not persisent, if you leave\
  \ the server you lose your Mana. If you collect 100 Mana points you get 999 health,\
  \ you get all weapons and your Mana is reset to 0.  What powers do you get for your\
  \ levels: * For each level you get 1 bonus health * For each level you get 0.5%\
  \ faster weapons * For each level you get 0.5% faster walking (quickfoot) and swimming\
  \ * For each level you can jump 0.5% higher * For level 20 and higher you regain\
  \ health at 1 health per 20 levels per second * For level 25 and higher you get\
  \ the ability to dodge jump * For level 50 and higher you get 2 ammo per second\
  \ for your current weapon  So for example someone at level 50 starts with 125 health,\
  \ has 25% more weapon speed, 25% faster walking, can jump 25% higher etc."
