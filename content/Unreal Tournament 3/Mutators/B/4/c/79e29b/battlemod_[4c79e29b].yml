description: "This small mutator allows you to tune some aspects of UT3. I made it\
  \ to allow custom settings but also to get some experience with the engine and its\
  \ development tools.  The following settings are available:  CfgGameSpeedMultiplier\
  \ - Total gamespeed (same as Speed Freak mutator). CfgWeaponSpeedMultiplier - Fire\
  \ rate of weapons. CfgWeaponSwitchSpeedMultiplier - Weapon swiching speed. CfgHoverVehicleSpeedMultiplier\
  \ - Hoverboard speed. CfgWalkingSpeedMultiplier - Walking speed. CfgHealthMultiplier\
  \ - Extra starting health. CfgJumpMultiplier - Extra high jumping. CfgbMaxAmmo -\
  \ Weapons get max ammo.  Default values of all settings (except CfgGameSpeedMultiplier)\
  \ are 1.5."
