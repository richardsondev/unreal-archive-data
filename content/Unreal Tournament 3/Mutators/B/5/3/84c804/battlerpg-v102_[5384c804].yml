description: "With BattleRPG each player gets a persistent level and persistent experience.\
  \ This means the server keeps a database and remembers your achievements permanently.\
  \ For each point you score you get experience, if you have enough experience you\
  \ go to the next level: * The first 25 levels are very easy to get players to learn\
  \ how RPG works * Reaching level 80 requires some serious playing but is doable\
  \ * Level 100 is tougher to reach * Over level 100 it becomes hard * Over level\
  \ 110 it becomes extremely hard  Besides experience and levels you also collect\
  \ Mana. Mana is not persisent, if you leave the server you lose your Mana. Mana\
  \ can be used for artifacts and for the Ultra GIB and Quantum weapon magic.  For\
  \ each level you get some RPG$. With those RPG$ you can buy abilities. You can press\
  \ the L button to open the BattleRPG menu and start buying (or selling) abilities.\
  \  Examples of abilities are 'Health bonus', 'Weapon speed', 'Vampirism' and 'Quick\
  \ foot'.  BattleRPG also has magic weapons. Examples of magic are 'Quantum', 'Bounce',\
  \ 'Knockback' and 'Ultra GIB'.  BattleRPG also has artifacts. Examples of artifacts\
  \ are 'God Mode', 'Spiderpig' and 'Mana Gambling'."
