description: "This is a fix for the 'package not found download was already attempted'\
  \ error that prevents UT3 server owners from installing custom maps on UT3 servers.\
  \ P1 has been tested on several Unreal servers and does indeed fix this problem\
  \ there. UT3Fixer is an ugly hack that seems to do the job. It is a temporary solution\
  \ allowing server owners to use custom maps until Epic releases UT3 1.3 which will\
  \ probably fix the problem.  It is based on a combination of disabling 'seamless\
  \ travel' while at the same time still keeping the players connected to the server\
  \ (disabling seamless travel will initially kick all players off the server)."
