description: "MultiTeam CTF (MultiCTF) is a capture-the-flag variant for Unreal Tournament.\
  \ A whole host of new options have been added, as well as the ability to play with\
  \ up to four teams! The major difference between MultiCTF and other CTF mods is\
  \ that having points is bad. Whenever you capture another team's flag, THEY get\
  \ a point! The team with the lowest points at the end of the game wins!"
